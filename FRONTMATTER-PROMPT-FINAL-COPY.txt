You are given a glossary article with optional metadata input. Your task is to generate ONLY the Hugo frontmatter metadata.

---

## INPUT FORMAT

You may receive metadata in this format (optional):
```
Category: [category name]
Keyword: [keyword name]
Description: [specific description for this keyword context]
```

**Important about Description input:**
- If Description is provided in input, it helps clarify which specific meaning/context this article covers
- This Description is for YOUR understanding to generate better frontmatter
- DO NOT use the input Description directly in frontmatter
- DO NOT include input metadata (Category, Keyword, Description) in the article body
- Input metadata is ONLY for guidance, not for direct output

---

## YOUR TASK

Generate ONLY the frontmatter section. DO NOT modify or include the input metadata in the article body.

---

## FRONTMATTER FORMAT

```
---
title: "[Keyword from input OR first H1 heading]"
date: [Current date YYYY-MM-DD]
translationKey: "[lowercase-hyphen-separated version of title]"
description: "[SEO optimized description of page, max 160 characters]"
keywords: ["[keyword1]", "[keyword2]", "[keyword3]", "[keyword4]", "[keyword5]"]
category: "[Category from input OR extracted from article OR 'General']"
type: "glossary"
draft: true
---
```

---

## FIELD GENERATION RULES

### title
- **Priority 1:** Use Keyword from input if provided
- **Priority 2:** Extract from first H1 heading (skip "Writing style definition" if present)
- **Format:** Keep as-is, wrap in quotes
- **Example:** `title: "Active Learning"`

### date
- Use current date (2025-11-25)
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- NO quotes
- **Example:** `date: 2025-11-25`

### translationKey
- Convert title to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters: ( ) / \ : ; , . " '
- **Examples:**
  - "Active Learning" → `translationKey: "active-learning"`
  - "Code Block (Python/JS)" → `translationKey: "code-block-python-js"`

### description
- **Generate an SEO-optimized description from the article content**
- **Maximum length:** 160 characters
- **Should be compelling and informative**
- **Include the main keyword naturally**
- **Wrap in quotes**
- **Example:** `description: "Learn what Active Learning is, how it works, and how to reduce labeling costs while improving model performance in machine learning."`

**Note:** If Description is provided in input, use it as context to understand the article's focus, but still create an SEO-optimized description based on the actual article content.

### keywords
- Extract top 5 most relevant keywords from article
- Include the main Keyword as first item
- Array format with quotes
- **Example:** `keywords: ["Active Learning", "Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning", "Data Annotation", "Human-in-the-Loop"]`

### category
- **Priority 1:** Use Category from input if provided
- **Priority 2:** Extract from "Category:" field in article
- **Priority 3:** Use "General" as default
- **Example:** `category: "AI Chatbot & Automation"`

### type
- Always: `type: "glossary"`

### draft
- Always: `draft: true` (boolean, NO quotes)

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Output ONLY the frontmatter section**
2. **Start with ---**
3. **End with ---**
4. **DO NOT use ```yaml annotation**
5. **DO NOT include input metadata (Category, Keyword, Description) in article body**
6. **Input metadata is ONLY for guidance, not direct output**
7. **DO NOT modify the article content**
8. **Generate SEO-optimized description (max 160 chars), do NOT copy input Description directly**

---

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: With Input Metadata

**Input Metadata:**
```
Category: AI Chatbot & Automation
Keyword: Active Learning
Description: A machine learning process where the model explicitly asks a human to label data points it is uncertain about.
```

**Article:**
```
# Active Learning

## What is Active Learning?

Active Learning is a supervised machine learning paradigm where an algorithm interactively selects the most informative data points from a large pool of unlabeled data, requesting labels from a human oracle...

```

**Output (ONLY frontmatter):**
```
---
title: "Active Learning"
date: 2025-11-25
translationKey: "active-learning"
description: "Learn what Active Learning is, how it works, and how to reduce labeling costs while improving ML model performance with targeted data annotation."
keywords: ["Active Learning", "Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning", "Data Annotation", "Query Strategy"]
category: "AI Chatbot & Automation"
type: "glossary"
draft: true
---
```

**Note:** 
- The input Description helped understand the context
- But the frontmatter description is SEO-optimized (160 chars max)
- Input metadata does NOT appear in article body

### Example 2: Without Input Metadata

**Article:**
```
# Neural Networks

## Introduction

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that learn from data to make predictions and decisions...

Category: Deep Learning

[rest of article]
```

**Output (ONLY frontmatter):**
```
---
title: "Neural Networks"
date: 2025-11-25
translationKey: "neural-networks"
description: "Discover how Neural Networks work, their architecture, training methods, and applications in deep learning and artificial intelligence systems."
keywords: ["Neural Networks", "Deep Learning", "Machine Learning", "Artificial Intelligence", "Backpropagation"]
category: "Deep Learning"
type: "glossary"
draft: true
---
```

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ DO NOT copy input Description directly:
```
---
description: "A machine learning process where the model explicitly asks a human to label data points it is uncertain about."
---
```

✅ CORRECT - Generate SEO-optimized description:
```
---
description: "Learn what Active Learning is, how it works, and how to reduce labeling costs while improving ML model performance."
---
```

❌ DO NOT include input metadata in article:
```
# Active Learning

Category: AI Chatbot & Automation
Keyword: Active Learning
Description: A machine learning process...

## What is Active Learning?
...
```

✅ CORRECT - Article body unchanged:
```
# Active Learning

## What is Active Learning?
...
```

---

## SEO-OPTIMIZED DESCRIPTION TIPS

- Start with action words: "Learn", "Discover", "Understand"
- Include main keyword naturally
- Mention key benefits or outcomes
- Keep under 160 characters
- Make it compelling and informative
- Answer "What will the reader learn?"

**Examples:**
- "Learn what Active Learning is, how it works, and how to reduce labeling costs in machine learning projects."
- "Discover Active Learning strategies, benefits, and implementation tips to improve your ML model performance efficiently."
- "Understand Active Learning: a machine learning approach that minimizes annotation costs while maximizing model accuracy."
