      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ai-customer-support&#34;&gt;What is AI Customer Support?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI customer support is a system that uses artificial intelligence to automatically respond to customer inquiries. Unlike human agents, AI can provide support 24/7, 365 days a year. Key features include instant responses and multilingual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system utilizes several technologies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps AI understand and respond to human language. Machine Learning is a mechanism that allows AI to expand and improve its knowledge. By integrating with databases, AI can reference vast amounts of information. Voice and image recognition capabilities enable handling of non-text inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition-and-role-of-knowledge-base&#34;&gt;Definition and Role of Knowledge Base&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Knowledge Base is a collection of organized information that includes business knowledge, know-how, work procedures, troubleshooting examples, and success stories used within companies and organizations.
