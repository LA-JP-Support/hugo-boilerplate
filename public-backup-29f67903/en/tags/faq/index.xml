      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition-and-role-of-knowledge-base&#34;&gt;Definition and Role of Knowledge Base&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Knowledge Base is a collection of organized information that includes business knowledge, know-how, work procedures, troubleshooting examples, and success stories used within companies and organizations. It serves as an information infrastructure that allows anyone to quickly look up necessary information when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge bases manage both tacit knowledge (knowledge gained from experience) and explicit knowledge (knowledge documented in manuals and other materials) in a database format. They are designed to provide efficient access to information using mechanisms such as AI search functionality, tagging, and hierarchical structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
