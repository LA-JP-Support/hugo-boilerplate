      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ai-customer-support&#34;&gt;What is AI Customer Support?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI customer support is a system that uses artificial intelligence to automatically respond to customer inquiries. Unlike human agents, AI can provide support 24/7, 365 days a year. Key features include instant responses and multilingual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This system utilizes several technologies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps AI understand and respond to human language. Machine Learning is a mechanism that allows AI to expand and improve its knowledge. By integrating with databases, AI can reference vast amounts of information. Voice and image recognition capabilities enable handling of non-text inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RAG vs. CAG: Understanding Knowledge Augmentation Strategies for AI Models</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Large language models have revolutionized how we interact with artificial intelligence, but they face a fundamental challenge: &lt;strong&gt;knowledge cutoff&lt;/strong&gt;. If information wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in a model&amp;rsquo;s training data, the model simply cannot recall it. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s recent news events, proprietary business data, or real-time information, traditional LLMs struggle to provide accurate answers about knowledge beyond their training window. This limitation has sparked the development of augmented generation techniques—methods that extend an AI model&amp;rsquo;s capabilities by connecting it to external knowledge sources. Two prominent approaches have emerged to solve this problem: &lt;strong&gt;Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG)&lt;/strong&gt;. Each offers distinct advantages and trade-offs, and understanding when to use each approach is crucial for building effective AI systems. This comprehensive guide explores both techniques in depth, examining their architectures, capabilities, and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
