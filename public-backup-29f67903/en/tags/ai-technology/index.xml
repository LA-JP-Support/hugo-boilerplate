      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, AI implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has gained attention as a realistic option for achieving operational efficiency and digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many SMEs face challenges such as &amp;ldquo;not knowing who handled what&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;missing responses&amp;rdquo; that arise from individually managing diverse inquiry channels—email, phone, SNS, and chat. The key to fundamentally resolving this confusion lies in implementing AI chatbots/), AI email auto-response generation, and ticket systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rapid advancement of AI technology, methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve daily. This article comprehensively explains cutting-edge evaluation techniques, challenges specific to Japanese-language models, and practical implementation strategies in language accessible to business leaders. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re considering AI building tools like FlowHunt, this serves as an invaluable reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-frontier-of-llm-automatic-evaluation-the-revolutionary-ai-as-judge-method&#34;&gt;The Frontier of LLM Automatic Evaluation: The Revolutionary &amp;ldquo;AI as Judge&amp;rdquo; Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, AI performance evaluation relied on two primary approaches. The first was &amp;ldquo;human evaluation,&amp;rdquo; where experts and general users manually reviewed AI responses to assess their accuracy, naturalness, and usefulness. The second involved &amp;ldquo;automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE,&amp;rdquo; where computers automatically compared AI-generated text with reference answers and quantified similarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Traditional AI created text and responses using only learned knowledge. RAG searches for necessary information from external sources like databases when questions arrive, then creates answers based on that information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, AI understands the question content and retrieves relevant information from search engines or specific databases. Next, using the found information, it creates answers in natural text. This method enables AI to immediately update knowledge and quickly reflect new information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Unlike scattered response methods such as email and phone calls, this system enables organizations to consolidate and record all inquiry information, response flows, and progress status in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a support representative, using this system allows you to easily share information with other team members, preventing response gaps and duplications. It also makes it easier to maintain consistent standards across all inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
