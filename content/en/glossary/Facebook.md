## What Is Facebook?

Facebook is the world's largest social networking platform, connecting over 3 billion monthly active users globally. Launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and fellow Harvard students, Facebook enables individuals, communities, and businesses to share content, communicate, and build relationships through text posts, photos, videos, live streams, and interactive features. The platform has evolved from a college networking site into a comprehensive digital ecosystem encompassing personal profiles, business pages, groups, marketplace, events, messaging, and advertising tools.

**Related:** Facebook is owned and operated by Meta Platforms Inc. For information about Meta's corporate structure, other products including Instagram and WhatsApp, and metaverse initiatives, see [Meta](Meta.md).

Facebook's influence extends far beyond personal networking, serving as critical infrastructure for digital marketing, community organization, news dissemination, and business communication worldwide. The platform's sophisticated algorithms curate personalized content feeds, connecting users with relevant posts, advertisements, and groups based on interests, behaviors, and social connections. With robust targeting capabilities and billions of users, Facebook has become essential for businesses ranging from local shops to global brands seeking to reach customers, build communities, and drive sales through social media presence and advertising.

The platform continues evolving with features like Facebook Live for real-time video broadcasting, Facebook Marketplace for local buying and selling, Facebook Groups for community building, Facebook Watch for video content, and Meta Business Suite for integrated management of Facebook and Instagram business presence. Despite facing challenges around privacy, content moderation, and market competition, Facebook remains the dominant force in social networking and a cornerstone of digital communication for billions worldwide.
