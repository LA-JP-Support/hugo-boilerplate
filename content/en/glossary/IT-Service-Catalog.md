## What is an IT Service Catalog?

An IT Service Catalog is a comprehensive, centralized repository that contains detailed information about all IT services available to an organization's users, customers, and stakeholders. It serves as the single source of truth for service offerings, providing a structured view of what services are available, their specifications, pricing, service level agreements (SLAs), and how to request them. The service catalog acts as a bridge between IT service providers and consumers, facilitating clear communication about service capabilities, requirements, and expectations while streamlining the service request and delivery process.

The concept of an IT Service Catalog is deeply rooted in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework, which defines it as a database or structured document containing information about all live IT services, including those available for deployment. Unlike a service portfolio that includes services in various stages of development, the service catalog specifically focuses on active services that are currently available to users. It typically consists of two main components: the Business Service Catalog, which presents services in business terms that end-users can understand, and the Technical Service Catalog, which contains detailed technical information about services, their dependencies, and supporting infrastructure components.

Modern IT Service Catalogs have evolved beyond simple static documents to become dynamic, interactive platforms that integrate with various IT service management (ITSM) tools and workflows. They often feature self-service portals where users can browse available services, compare options, submit requests, track progress, and provide feedback. These catalogs support automated workflows, approval processes, and integration with configuration management databases (CMDBs), enabling organizations to maintain accurate, up-to-date service information while reducing administrative overhead. The catalog serves multiple stakeholders, including end-users seeking services, IT staff managing service delivery, business managers making strategic decisions, and executives monitoring service performance and costs.

## Core Service Catalog Components

<strong>Service Definitions</strong>encompass detailed descriptions of each IT service, including its purpose, functionality, and business value. These definitions provide clear explanations of what the service does, who can use it, and how it supports business objectives, ensuring users understand the service's relevance to their needs.

<strong>Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</strong>define the performance standards, availability commitments, and quality metrics for each service. SLAs establish clear expectations between service providers and consumers, specifying response times, resolution targets, uptime guarantees, and consequences for non-compliance.

<strong>Request Fulfillment Processes</strong>outline the standardized procedures for requesting, approving, and delivering services. These processes include submission requirements, approval workflows, provisioning steps, and communication protocols that ensure consistent service delivery experiences.

<strong>Pricing and Cost Models</strong>provide transparent information about service costs, billing methods, and financial arrangements. This component helps users make informed decisions about service consumption while enabling IT departments to implement cost recovery and chargeback mechanisms.

<strong>Service Dependencies and Relationships</strong>map the interconnections between services and their supporting infrastructure components. This information helps users understand service limitations and enables IT staff to assess the impact of changes or incidents on service availability.

<strong>Access Controls and Entitlements</strong>define who can request specific services based on roles, departments, locations, or other organizational criteria. These controls ensure appropriate service access while maintaining security and compliance requirements.

<strong>Service Metrics and Performance Data</strong>present key performance indicators, usage statistics, and satisfaction scores for each service. This information enables continuous improvement efforts and helps users evaluate service quality and reliability.

## How IT Service Catalog Works

The IT Service Catalog operates through a systematic workflow that begins with <strong>Service Discovery and Documentation</strong>, where IT teams identify all available services, gather detailed information about their capabilities, requirements, and dependencies, and document this information in a standardized format that can be easily understood by both technical and non-technical users.

<strong>Service Classification and Categorization</strong>follows, organizing services into logical groups based on business function, technology type, user audience, or other relevant criteria, making it easier for users to navigate and locate appropriate services while enabling better service management and reporting.

<strong>Catalog Publication and Presentation</strong>involves making the service information available through user-friendly interfaces, typically web-based portals that allow users to browse services, view detailed descriptions, compare options, and access request forms with intuitive navigation and search capabilities.

<strong>Request Submission and Validation</strong>occurs when users submit service requests through the catalog interface, with the system automatically validating request completeness, checking user entitlements, and routing requests to appropriate approval workflows based on predefined business rules and service requirements.

<strong>Approval and Authorization Processing</strong>manages the review and approval of service requests according to established governance policies, involving relevant stakeholders such as managers, security teams, or budget owners, while maintaining audit trails and communication with requesters about status updates.

<strong>Service Provisioning and Delivery</strong>encompasses the actual fulfillment of approved requests through automated or manual processes, including resource allocation, configuration, testing, and deployment activities that result in the delivery of functional services to end-users.

<strong>Monitoring and Feedback Collection</strong>involves tracking service performance against defined SLAs, gathering user satisfaction feedback, and monitoring usage patterns to identify improvement opportunities and ensure ongoing service quality.

<strong>Catalog Maintenance and Updates</strong>ensures that service information remains accurate and current through regular reviews, updates based on service changes, retirement of obsolete services, and addition of new offerings as they become available.

For example, when an employee requests a new software application through the service catalog, the system validates their eligibility, routes the request for manager approval, automatically provisions the software license, configures access permissions, and notifies the user when the service is ready for use.
