## What is a Session Recording?

Session recording is a digital analytics technology that captures and records user interactions with websites, web applications, or mobile applications in real-time. This technology creates a visual replay of a user's complete journey through a digital interface, documenting every click, scroll, mouse movement, form input, and navigation action during their visit. Unlike traditional analytics that provide quantitative data points, session recording offers qualitative insights by showing exactly how users behave and interact with digital products.

The technology works by embedding JavaScript code or software development kits (SDKs) into web pages or applications that continuously monitor and capture user actions. These recordings are then processed, stored, and made available for analysis through specialized platforms. Session recordings provide product managers, UX designers, developers, and marketers with unprecedented visibility into user behavior patterns, allowing them to identify usability issues, optimization opportunities, and areas of friction in the user experience. The recordings can reveal insights that traditional metrics cannot capture, such as user hesitation, confusion points, or unexpected interaction patterns.

Modern session recording solutions have evolved to include advanced features such as heatmap generation, conversion funnel analysis, error tracking, and privacy protection mechanisms. These tools have become essential components of comprehensive user experience optimization strategies, enabling data-driven decision making based on actual user behavior rather than assumptions. Organizations across industries leverage session recording to improve conversion rates, reduce customer support inquiries, enhance product usability, and ultimately create more intuitive and effective digital experiences for their users.

## Core Session Recording Technologies

• <strong>DOM-Based Recording</strong>: Captures changes to the Document Object Model (DOM) structure and recreates user sessions by tracking element modifications, style changes, and content updates. This method provides lightweight recordings with smaller file sizes and faster processing capabilities.

• <strong>Video-Based Recording</strong>: Creates actual video recordings of user screens during their sessions, capturing every visual element and interaction exactly as the user experienced it. This approach provides the most accurate representation but requires more storage space and bandwidth.

• <strong>Event-Driven Capture</strong>: Monitors and logs specific user events such as clicks, scrolls, form submissions, and keyboard inputs, then reconstructs the session based on these recorded events. This method offers efficient data collection while maintaining detailed interaction tracking.

• <strong>Hybrid Recording Systems</strong>: Combines multiple recording technologies to balance accuracy, performance, and storage efficiency. These systems typically use DOM-based recording as the primary method while incorporating video capture for specific elements or critical user flows.

• <strong>Real-Time Streaming</strong>: Enables live monitoring of user sessions as they occur, allowing support teams or analysts to observe user behavior in real-time. This technology is particularly valuable for customer support and immediate issue identification.

• <strong>Mobile SDK Integration</strong>: Specialized recording technology designed for mobile applications that captures touch gestures, device orientation changes, app state transitions, and native mobile interactions. These SDKs are optimized for mobile performance and battery efficiency.

• <strong>Privacy-Compliant Recording</strong>: Advanced recording systems that automatically detect and mask sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data while maintaining the integrity of the user experience recording.

## How Session Recording Works

The session recording process follows a systematic workflow that begins when a user visits a website or opens an application:

1. <strong>Initialization</strong>: The session recording script loads with the page and establishes a connection with the recording service, creating a unique session identifier and initializing monitoring capabilities.

2. <strong>Event Monitoring</strong>: The system begins capturing user interactions including mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, keyboard inputs, form field changes, and page navigation events through event listeners attached to DOM elements.

3. <strong>Data Collection</strong>: All captured events are timestamped and serialized into a structured format, along with contextual information such as viewport size, device type, browser information, and page metadata.

4. <strong>Privacy Filtering</strong>: The system applies privacy rules to mask or exclude sensitive information such as passwords, payment details, and personally identifiable information before processing the data.

5. <strong>Data Transmission</strong>: Captured session data is transmitted to recording servers either in real-time or in batches, depending on the configuration and network conditions, using secure protocols to ensure data integrity.

6. <strong>Processing and Storage</strong>: Server-side systems process the raw session data, optimize it for playback, generate additional metadata, and store it in databases designed for efficient retrieval and analysis.

7. <strong>Replay Generation</strong>: When analysts request session playback, the system reconstructs the user experience by applying the recorded events in chronological order, creating a visual representation of the original session.

8. <strong>Analysis Integration</strong>: The processed session data is integrated with analytics platforms, enabling correlation with other metrics and providing comprehensive insights into user behavior patterns.

<strong>Example Workflow</strong>: A user visits an e-commerce website, browses product categories, adds items to their cart, and abandons the checkout process. The session recording captures every interaction, revealing that the user hesitated at the shipping cost display, scrolled back to review product details multiple times, and ultimately left when encountering a complex form field, providing actionable insights for optimization.

## Key Benefits

• <strong>Enhanced User Experience Understanding</strong>: Session recordings provide deep insights into actual user behavior, revealing pain points, confusion areas, and interaction patterns that traditional analytics cannot capture, enabling more informed UX design decisions.
