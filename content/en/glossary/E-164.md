## What is an E.164?

E.164 is the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendation that defines the international public telecommunication numbering plan. This fundamental standard establishes a globally unique numbering scheme for telephone numbers, enabling seamless international communication across diverse telecommunications networks worldwide. The E.164 standard provides a structured format that ensures every telephone number can be uniquely identified and routed to its intended destination, regardless of the originating country or telecommunications provider.

The E.164 numbering plan was first introduced in 1984 and has undergone several revisions to accommodate the growing global telecommunications infrastructure and emerging technologies. The standard defines a maximum length of 15 digits for international telephone numbers, including the country code, and establishes the framework for national numbering plans within each country. This standardization has been crucial for the development of modern telecommunications, enabling everything from basic voice calls to advanced services like SMS, MMS, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications.

At its core, E.164 serves as the universal language for telephone numbering, providing a consistent structure that telecommunications equipment, software systems, and service providers can interpret and process. The standard encompasses not only traditional landline and mobile phone numbers but also extends to various telecommunications services including fax numbers, paging systems, and emerging digital communication platforms. Understanding E.164 is essential for telecommunications professionals, software developers working with communication systems, and organizations implementing global communication solutions, as it forms the foundation upon which modern international telecommunications operates.

## Core E.164 Components

• **Country Code (CC)**: The 1-3 digit prefix that identifies the country or geographical area where the telephone number is registered. Country codes are assigned by the ITU and range from single digits for major countries like the United States (+1) to three digits for smaller nations and territories.

• **National Destination Code (NDC)**: The portion of the telephone number that follows the country code and identifies a specific geographical area, mobile network, or service type within the country. The NDC length varies by country and can indicate regional areas, mobile operators, or special service categories.

• **Subscriber Number (SN)**: The final portion of the E.164 number that uniquely identifies the individual subscriber within the designated area or network. This component ensures that each telephone number is unique within its assigned numbering space and can be properly routed to the correct destination.

• **International Prefix**: The access code used to initiate international calls, typically "00" in most countries or "011" in North America. While not part of the E.164 number itself, this prefix is essential for dialing international numbers from traditional telephone systems.

• **Plus Sign (+) Notation**: The standardized way to represent the international dialing prefix in E.164 format, replacing country-specific international access codes. This notation is widely used in mobile phones, contact databases, and modern communication systems to ensure universal compatibility.

• **Number Length Constraints**: The E.164 standard mandates that complete international telephone numbers must not exceed 15 digits total, including the country code. This constraint ensures compatibility across global telecommunications infrastructure while providing sufficient numbering space for most countries.

• **Numbering Plan Areas**: Geographical or administrative regions within countries that have distinct numbering schemes or routing requirements. These areas help organize national numbering plans and facilitate efficient call routing within telecommunications networks.

## How E.164 Works

The E.164 numbering system operates through a hierarchical structure that enables global telecommunications routing and identification:

1. **Number Assignment**: National telecommunications authorities assign E.164 numbers within their allocated country code space, following ITU guidelines and national numbering plans to ensure uniqueness and proper structure.

2. **International Recognition**: When a call is initiated, telecommunications equipment recognizes the E.164 format and parses the country code to determine the destination country and appropriate routing path through international gateways.

3. **Network Routing**: International telecommunications carriers use the country code and national destination code to route calls through appropriate network infrastructure, including submarine cables, satellite links, and terrestrial connections.

4. **National Processing**: Upon reaching the destination country, national telecommunications networks process the national destination code and subscriber number to identify the specific local exchange or mobile network responsible for the target number.

5. **Local Delivery**: The local telecommunications infrastructure completes the call routing to the final destination, whether it's a landline, mobile phone, or other telecommunications service, using the subscriber number for precise identification.

6. **Reverse Lookup Capability**: E.164 numbers enable reverse identification processes, allowing systems to determine the originating country and potentially the service type or geographical area of incoming calls for security and routing purposes.

7. **Database Integration**: Telecommunications systems maintain extensive databases of E.164 number allocations, enabling features like caller identification, spam detection, and regulatory compliance across international boundaries.**Example Workflow**: A call from +1-555-123-4567 (United States) to +44-20-7946-0958 (United Kingdom) involves parsing the country codes (+1 and +44), routing through international gateways, and delivering to the London area (20) subscriber (7946-0958).
