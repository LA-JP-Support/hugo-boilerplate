## What Is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is a computer program that simulates conversation with humans, typically through text or voice. Chatbots are deployed on websites, messaging apps, mobile apps, customer service portals, and smart devices. They are available around the clock, providing consistent, automated responses to user inquiries.

<strong>Chatbot vs AI Chatbot:</strong>This article covers chatbots in general, including rule-based, AI-powered, and hybrid systems. For detailed information specifically about AI-powered chatbots using large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and advanced machine learning, see our dedicated AI Chatbot article. The key distinction: general chatbots can range from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated AI, while AI chatbots specifically refer to systems powered by advanced AI technologies like LLMs for context-aware, generative responses.

<strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>- Simulates human-like conversation (text or voice)
- Available 24/7 without human intervention
- Handles simple to complex queries, autonomously or with escalation
- Can be powered by simple rules, advanced AI, or a combination

Chatbots range from basic, rule-based systems that follow scripted logic, to sophisticated AI-powered models leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) for context-aware and adaptive responses.

## How Are Chatbots Used?

Chatbots automate and streamline interactions between humans and digital systems, dramatically increasing efficiency and reducing manual workload. Common use cases include:

<strong>Customer Support</strong>FAQs, troubleshooting, ticket management, and issue triage.

<strong>Sales Assistance</strong>Lead qualification, product recommendations, order tracking.

<strong>Internal Help Desk</strong>Employee HR/IT queries, onboarding, password resets.

<strong>Marketing</strong>Website visitor engagement, surveys, lead nurturing.

<strong>Data Collection</strong>User feedback, surveys, preference gathering.

<strong>Scheduling</strong>Appointment bookings, reminders, event registrations.

<strong>Example:</strong>A retail chatbot on an e-commerce site helps customers find products, check order status, answer policy questions, and can escalate complex issues to a live agent.

## Types of Chatbots

Chatbots can be categorized by the technology underpinning their interaction style and complexity:

### Rule-Based Chatbots
Rule-based chatbots (also known as decision-tree or flow-based bots) operate based on predefined scripts and logic. They match keywords or phrases to scripted responses using decision trees or menus.

<strong>Strengths:</strong>Predictable, easy to deploy, effective for FAQs and repetitive tasks.  
<strong>Limitations:</strong>Cannot handle ambiguous or complex queries, limited to their programmed knowledge.

<strong>Example:</strong>A banking chatbot that replies to "What are your branch hours?" with a static, pre-written answer.

### AI-Powered Chatbots
AI-powered chatbots use NLP, NLU, and ML to interpret, learn, and respond flexibly to a wide variety of questions. They analyze user intent, parse complex queries, extract entities (like dates/locations), and generate dynamic, context-aware answers.

<strong>Strengths:</strong>Handle complex language, improve over time, offer personalized experiences.  
<strong>Limitations:</strong>Require large datasets, ongoing training, and careful monitoring.

<strong>Example:</strong>A travel chatbot interprets "Find me a flight to Tokyo next Friday" and returns tailored booking options.

### Hybrid Chatbots
Hybrid chatbots combine rule-based and AI-powered approaches, using scripts for simple tasks and AI for complex or ambiguous requests. They handle routine queries with rules, escalate to AI for nuanced conversations.

<strong>Strengths:</strong>Balance reliability and flexibility.  
<strong>Limitations:</strong>More complex to design and maintain.

<strong>Example:</strong>A tech support bot uses rules for basic troubleshooting and invokes AI for advanced diagnostics.

### AI Agents
AI agents (also known as intelligent virtual assistants or agentic AI) are chatbots capable of autonomous task execution and decision-making, deeply integrated with backend systems. They understand context, trigger workflows, resolve issues without human intervention.

<strong>Strengths:</strong>Autonomous, proactive, context-aware, manage end-to-end processes.  
<strong>Limitations:</strong>Require robust system integration and governance.

<strong>Example:</strong>A telecom AI agent detects a service outage, initiates a fix, and notifies the customer automatically.

## How Chatbots Work

### Rule-Based Chatbot Workflow

<strong>1. User Input:</strong>The user types a message or selects from menu options.  
<strong>2. Pattern Detection:</strong>The chatbot scans for predefined keywords or phrases.  
<strong>3. Rule Matching:</strong>Matches input to a path in its decision tree.  
<strong>4. Response Generation:</strong>Delivers a scripted response or prompts for more information.  
<strong>5. Loop or Escalate:</strong>Continues or escalates to a human if needed.

<strong>Flow Example:</strong>- User: "How do I reset my password?"
- Chatbot: Detects "reset password," sends step-by-step instructions.

### AI Chatbot Workflow

<strong>1. User Input:</strong>User sends a message in natural language (text or voice).  
<strong>2. Tokenization:</strong>Input is split into words or phrases (tokens).  
<strong>3. Intent Classification:</strong>NLP/NLU determines what the user wants (intent).  
<strong>4. Entity Recognition:</strong>Extracts key details (dates, product names, locations).  
<strong>5. Knowledge Base Analysis:</strong>Searches internal documentation for the answer.  
<strong>6. Response Generation (NLG):</strong>Constructs a human-like reply.  
<strong>7. Learning Loop:</strong>ML algorithms improve the bot over time based on interactions.

<strong>Flow Example:</strong>- User: "What's the refund policy for shoes bought last week?"
- Chatbot: Recognizes date/product, fetches the relevant policy, crafts a personalized reply.
