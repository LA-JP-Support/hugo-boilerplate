## What is a Baidu?

Baidu is China's largest search engine and one of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, often referred to as "China's Google." Founded in 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu, Baidu has evolved from a simple search engine into a comprehensive technology ecosystem that encompasses search, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, cloud computing, and various digital services. The company's name derives from a classical Chinese poem, meaning "hundreds of times," symbolizing the persistent search for the ideal. With its headquarters in Beijing, Baidu operates as the dominant internet search provider in China, commanding over 70% of the Chinese search market share and serving billions of search queries daily.

The company's core mission centers on making the complex world simpler through technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Baidu has positioned itself as an AI-first company, investing heavily in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous driving technologies. Unlike Western search engines that primarily focus on web indexing and advertising, Baidu has developed a unique ecosystem tailored to Chinese internet users' preferences and behaviors. This includes integration with Chinese social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and mobile payment systems, creating a more localized and culturally relevant search experience. The platform supports simplified Chinese characters and understands the nuances of Chinese language queries, making it indispensable for businesses targeting Chinese consumers.

Baidu's influence extends far beyond traditional search functionality, encompassing a vast array of services including Baidu Maps, Baidu Cloud, Baidu Encyclopedia (Baike), and the DuerOS conversational AI platform. The company has also ventured into autonomous driving through its Apollo project, smart speakers with Xiaodu, and various AI-powered applications for healthcare, finance, and education. For international businesses seeking to enter the Chinese market, understanding Baidu's ecosystem is crucial, as it serves as the primary gateway for Chinese consumers to discover products, services, and information online. The platform's advertising system, Baidu Tuiguang, represents one of the most effective ways to reach Chinese audiences, making Baidu knowledge essential for digital marketers and businesses operating in or targeting China.

## How Baidu Works

**Step 1: Web Crawling and Indexing**: Baidu's web crawlers, known as Baiduspider, systematically scan and index Chinese websites, prioritizing content that complies with local regulations and user preferences.**Step 2: Content Processing**: The indexed content undergoes natural language processing using ERNIE and other AI models to understand context, extract entities, and categorize information according to Chinese language patterns.**Step 3: Query Analysis**: When users submit search queries, Baidu analyzes the intent, context, and semantic meaning using advanced NLP algorithms optimized for Chinese language nuances and colloquialisms.**Step 4: Relevance Ranking**: The search algorithm evaluates indexed content against the query using hundreds of ranking factors, including content quality, authority, user engagement, and mobile-friendliness.**Step 5: Personalization**: Results are customized based on user location, search history, device type, and behavioral patterns to provide more relevant and personalized search experiences.**Step 6: Result Presentation**: Search results are displayed with rich snippets, knowledge panels, and integrated services like maps, images, and videos, optimized for Chinese user interface preferences.**Example Workflow**: A user searching for "北京餐厅" (Beijing restaurants) triggers Baidu to analyze the local intent, retrieve relevant restaurant listings, integrate map data, display user reviews, and present results with booking options and promotional content from Baidu's advertising partners.
