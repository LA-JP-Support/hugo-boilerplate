## What is Botpress?

Botpress is a comprehensive platform for designing, building, deploying, and managing AI-powered chatbots and conversational agents. Its core is a low-code visual flow editor that integrates advanced artificial intelligence, including direct support for large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude, and Google Gemini.

Designed for both developers and non-technical users, Botpress offers a robust, scalable solution for automating conversations across customer support, sales, HR, and more.

<strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>- Visual, drag-and-drop conversation and automation design
- AI-powered NLU and NLP capabilities
- Seamless integration with enterprise systems and external data sources
- Omnichannel deployment (websites, messaging apps, internal tools)
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance (SOC II, GDPR)

## Core Features

### Visual Flow Builder

The Botpress Flow Editor enables users to design conversations and automation logic visually. Unlike code-based platforms, it allows teams to map user journeys and structure interactions without deep programming knowledge.

<strong>Key Functionalities:</strong>- Modular blocks (nodes and cards) for messages, questions, logic, and actions
- Conditional logic with if-then branching and complex expressions
- Reusable flows for scalability and efficient maintenance
- Balance of no-code interface and pro-code extensibility

### AI & LLM Integration

Botpress enables native integration with leading LLMs:
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Meta Llama, Mistral, and more

<strong>Capabilities:</strong>- Natural language understanding for intent recognition and entity extraction
- Autonomous nodes letting LLMs choose actions dynamically
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) grounding responses in your documents and knowledge bases
- Google AI Gemini integration for content generation and real-time services

<strong>RAG Details:</strong>RAG combines LLMs with retrieval from trusted data sources like PDFs and knowledge bases, ensuring accurate and up-to-date answers without hallucinations—critical for compliance-driven use cases.

### Knowledge Base Support

Botpress provides advanced knowledge base functionality leveraging vector databases and semantic search.

<strong>Capabilities:</strong>- Website and file ingestion (URLs, PDFs, documents, tables)
- Vector database storage for semantic representations
- Live updates as business information changes
- Autonomous node for automatic search and answer retrieval

<strong>Best Practices:</strong>- Prioritize structured data and ensure data quality
- Use automated ingestion tools and organize knowledge logically
- Apply ROT (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) analysis to maintain clean data

### Omnichannel Deployment
