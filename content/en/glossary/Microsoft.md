## What is a Microsoft?

Microsoft Corporation stands as one of the world's largest and most influential technology companies, fundamentally shaping the computing landscape since its founding in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Originally established to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 microcomputer, Microsoft has evolved into a multinational technology giant that creates computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. The company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, serves as the nerve center for operations spanning across virtually every continent, making Microsoft a truly global enterprise that touches billions of lives daily through its diverse portfolio of products and services.

The company's transformation from a small software startup to a technology behemoth reflects the broader evolution of the computing industry itself. Microsoft's early success with MS-DOS and subsequently Windows established the foundation for personal computing as we know it today. The graphical user interface revolution that Windows brought to mainstream computing democratized technology access, making computers usable for everyday consumers rather than just technical specialists. This accessibility principle has remained central to Microsoft's philosophy, driving innovations that bridge the gap between complex technology and user-friendly experiences across multiple platforms and devices.

Today's Microsoft operates as a comprehensive technology ecosystem provider, offering everything from operating systems and productivity software to cloud computing services and artificial intelligence platforms. The company's strategic pivot toward cloud-first, mobile-first computing under CEO Satya Nadella's leadership has repositioned Microsoft as a leader in enterprise digital transformation. With annual revenues exceeding $200 billion and a market capitalization that frequently places it among the world's most valuable companies, Microsoft's influence extends far beyond software into areas such as gaming, hardware manufacturing, professional networking, and emerging technologies like mixed reality and quantum computing.
