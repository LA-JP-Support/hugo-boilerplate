## What is Stack AI?

Stack AI is an enterprise-grade, no-code/low-code platform for building, testing, and deploying AI-powered workflows and agents, centered around advanced large language models (LLMs). Founded by Antoni Rosinol and Bernardo Aceituno, both former MIT PhDs, Stack AI addresses the challenge of connecting business data with cutting-edge AI models.

The platform enables organizations to connect disparate data sources and business systems, automate complex processes, and deploy AI assistants at scale—all without requiring deep programming expertise. Stack AI targets enterprises needing secure, compliant, and scalable AI-driven operations.

**Key Characteristics:**

**No-code/low-code builder:** Drag-and-drop workflow creation, modular steps, and plain English descriptions scaffold automation

**LLM Integration:** Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Cohere models

**Security/compliance:** SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant

**Integration ecosystem:** 100+ SaaS, cloud, database, and API connectors

**Flexible deployment:** Cloud, on-premise, VPC, web, chat, API, Slack, Teams, embedded widgets

**Enterprise focus:** Designed for regulated industries and large-scale automation with granular access controls

## How Stack AI is Used

### Core Usage Patterns

Stack AI streamlines knowledge-driven, repetitive, or labor-intensive business workflows by combining LLMs with a visual workflow builder:

**AI Agent Creation:** Build custom chatbots, document analyzers, knowledge assistants, and RAG bots through a modular builder

**Document Processing:** Extract, classify, and process data from PDFs, contracts, spreadsheets at scale

**Workflow Automation:** Orchestrate business logic—ingesting emails, querying CRMs, generating reports, posting to Slack

**Data Integration:** Connect unstructured data from SharePoint, Salesforce, Notion, Snowflake, Google Drive

**Custom Interfaces:** Deploy through web widgets, forms, Slack/Teams bots, or API endpoints

**Example Workflow:**  
Read PDF from Google Drive → Extract key data with OCR → Analyze with Claude or GPT-4 → Write summary to Salesforce → Notify team on Slack

### Who Uses Stack AI

**Finance & Insurance:** Automate document review and compliance

**Healthcare:** Build HIPAA-compliant co-pilots for physicians, automate charting, and EHR extraction

**Education:** AI tutors, knowledge assistants, administrative bots

**Agencies & Marketing:** Content QA, onboarding flows, knowledge bots

**IT & Operations:** Back-office automation, RFP management, data extraction

**Non-technical users:** No-code interface enables business analysts and operations managers to build automations

**Technical leads:** API and deep integration support for developers

**Customer Examples:** HP, SmartAsset, Red Bull, IBM, MIT

## Key Features

### No-Code Workflow Builder

**Visual drag-and-drop:** Compose workflows from modular "nodes" (data sources, logic, AI models, outputs)

**Quick Start/Custom modes:** Use templates or design from scratch

**Conversational builder:** Scaffold workflows by describing them in plain English

**Advanced logic:** Parallel, conditional, and multi-source aggregation supported

**Reusable components:** Save and reuse workflow templates across the organization

### Integration Ecosystem

Over 100 integrations with SaaS, cloud storage, databases, communication platforms, and APIs:

**Data:** Google Drive, OneDrive, Snowflake, SharePoint, Notion, MongoDB, Airtable, AWS S3, BigQuery

**Business apps:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, GitHub

**Messaging:** Slack, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, SMS

**AI providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere

**Custom APIs:** Connect any RESTful service; Managed Custom Processes (MCP) nodes allow advanced integrations

**Integration setup:** OAuth authentication, reusable across workflows

### Multi-Channel Interfaces

**Web chatbots:** Embeddable on websites or internal portals

**Forms:** Structured data collection with AI-powered feedback

**Batch processing:** Analyze documents in bulk

**Slack/Teams bots:** Bring AI assistants into collaboration tools

**API endpoints:** Embed workflows into custom applications

**Custom UI branding:** Tailor chatbots and forms with company branding

**Granular access control:** Manage who can use or modify each interface

### Advanced AI Capabilities

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Connect LLMs to proprietary data for context-aware answers with citations

**Data extraction/classification:** OCR for scanned documents, structured data extraction

**Prompt engineering:** Tune LLM instructions, collect feedback, iterate on agent behavior

**Custom LLM selection:** Assign specific models (GPT-4, Claude 3) to different workflow steps

**Knowledge base search:** Vector database support for semantic retrieval

### Security, Compliance, and Access Control

**Compliance:** SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR certified—suitable for regulated industries

**Deployment:** Cloud, on-premise, or VPC for dedicated infrastructure

**SSO:** Integrates with enterprise identity providers

**Role-based permissions:** Fine-grained access, audit trails for compliance

## Use Cases and Examples

### Financial Document Review

**Challenge:** High-volume loan or credit application processing

**Workflow:** Ingest documents → OCR and LLM extraction of key terms → Cross-reference databases → Generate reports → Notify on Slack

**Outcome:** Review time reduced from hours to minutes, fewer manual errors

### Healthcare Patient Co-Pilot

**Challenge:** Reduce administrative time for physicians

**Workflow:** Integrate with EHR → Summarize history, generate SOAP notes → Deploy secure chatbot in Teams

**Outcome:** Improved documentation, more time for patient care

### AI Knowledge Assistant

**Challenge:** Employees need instant, accurate answers from internal docs

**Workflow:** Load knowledge base → RAG workflow retrieves relevant info → LLM generates cited answers → Deploy as web/Slack bot

**Outcome:** Boosts productivity, reduces helpdesk tickets

### Automated RFP Management

**Challenge:** Tedious, repetitive RFP/questionnaire responses

**Workflow:** Ingest RFPs → Draft responses with LLM/templates → Route for review → Submit and track progress

**Outcome:** Faster, more consistent RFP turnaround

### Marketing Content QA

**Challenge:** Review volume and quality of marketing copy

**Workflow:** Pull drafts → LLM checks for grammar, compliance → Summarize feedback → Notify managers

**Outcome:** Faster, higher-quality reviews, lower risk

## Technical Architecture

Stack AI's technical foundation is modular and cloud-native:

**Node-based workflow engine:** Each step is a modular node (data, logic, AI, output)

**Connector ecosystem:** 100+ connectors for SaaS, databases, APIs

**Model orchestration:** Assign/manage LLMs per workflow step; supports prompt/context injection

**Deployment:** SaaS, VPC, or on-premise

**Monitoring/logging:** Detailed run history, error tracking, analytics

**Vector databases:** Power semantic search and RAG
