## How Is Stack AI Used?

### Core Usage Patterns

Stack AI streamlines knowledge-driven, repetitive, or labor-intensive business workflows by combining LLMs with a visual workflow builder:

- **AI Agent Creation:** Build custom chatbots, document analyzers, knowledge assistants, and “RAG” bots through a modular builder.
- **Document Processing:** Extract, classify, and process data from PDFs, contracts, spreadsheets, and more, at scale.
- **Workflow Automation:** Orchestrate business logic—e.g., ingesting emails, querying CRMs, generating reports, posting to Slack.
- **Data Integration:** Connect unstructured data from platforms like SharePoint, Salesforce, Notion, Snowflake, Google Drive, etc.
- **Custom Interfaces:** Deploy through web widgets, forms, Slack/Teams bots, or API endpoints.

**Example workflow:**  
Read PDF from Google Drive → Extract key data with OCR → Analyze with Claude or GPT-4 → Write summary to Salesforce → Notify team on Slack.

### Who Uses Stack AI?

- **Finance & Insurance:** Automate document review and compliance (see [Finance solutions](https://www.stack-ai.com/solutions/finance) and [Insurance solutions](https://www.stack-ai.com/solutions/insurance)).
- **Healthcare:** Build HIPAA-compliant co-pilots for physicians, automate charting, and EHR extraction ([Healthcare solutions](https://www.stack-ai.com/solutions/healthcare)).
- **Education:** AI tutors, knowledge assistants, administrative bots ([Education solutions](https://www.stack-ai.com/solutions/education)).
- **Agencies & Marketing:** Content QA, onboarding flows, knowledge bots.
