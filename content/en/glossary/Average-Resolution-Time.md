## What is an Average Resolution Time?

Average Resolution Time (ART) represents a critical performance metric in IT service management and customer support operations that measures the mean duration required to completely resolve incidents, service requests, or support tickets from the moment they are reported until they are fully closed. This metric serves as a fundamental indicator of operational efficiency, resource allocation effectiveness, and overall service quality within an organization's support infrastructure. The calculation involves summing the total resolution time for all resolved incidents within a specific period and dividing by the number of incidents resolved during that same timeframe.

The significance of Average Resolution Time extends beyond simple performance measurement, as it directly impacts customer satisfaction, service level agreement compliance, and business continuity. Organizations utilize this metric to establish baseline performance standards, identify improvement opportunities, and make data-driven decisions regarding staffing levels, training requirements, and process optimization initiatives. The metric provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of troubleshooting procedures, the adequacy of knowledge management systems, and the overall maturity of incident management processes within an organization.

Understanding Average Resolution Time requires careful consideration of various factors that influence resolution duration, including incident complexity, technician skill levels, available resources, escalation procedures, and external dependencies. Organizations must establish clear definitions for when the resolution timer starts and stops, ensuring consistent measurement across different types of incidents and support channels. The metric becomes particularly valuable when analyzed in conjunction with other key performance indicators such as First Call Resolution Rate, Mean Time to Acknowledge, and Customer Satisfaction Scores, providing a comprehensive view of support operation effectiveness and enabling targeted improvement strategies.

## Core Metrics and Components

**Resolution Time Calculation**involves measuring the elapsed time from incident creation to final closure, excluding any time spent in pending states where the ticket awaits customer response or external vendor action. This calculation ensures accurate representation of actual work time invested in resolving issues.**Incident Classification Systems**categorize support requests based on priority levels, complexity, and business impact to enable meaningful comparison of resolution times across similar incident types. Proper classification ensures that average resolution time metrics reflect realistic performance expectations for different categories of issues.**Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**establish contractual commitments for maximum resolution times based on incident priority and business impact, providing clear targets against which average resolution time performance can be measured. These agreements create accountability and set customer expectations for support response times.**Escalation Procedures**define the process for transferring incidents to higher-level support tiers when initial resolution attempts are unsuccessful, directly impacting average resolution time through the additional handoff and knowledge transfer requirements. Effective escalation procedures minimize delays while ensuring appropriate expertise is applied to complex issues.**Knowledge Management Integration**provides support technicians with access to documented solutions, troubleshooting guides, and historical incident data to accelerate problem resolution and reduce average resolution times. Well-maintained knowledge bases enable consistent and efficient resolution approaches across the support team.**Resource Allocation Models**determine staffing levels, skill distribution, and workload management strategies that directly influence the organization's ability to maintain optimal average resolution times during varying demand periods. Proper resource planning ensures adequate capacity to meet resolution time targets consistently.**Performance Monitoring Systems**continuously track resolution time metrics, generate alerts for SLA violations, and provide real-time visibility into support operation performance to enable proactive management of average resolution time targets. These systems facilitate data-driven decision making and rapid response to performance issues.

## How Average Resolution Time Works

The Average Resolution Time process begins when an incident is initially reported through any support channel, triggering the creation of a support ticket with a unique identifier and timestamp that marks the official start of the resolution timer. The system automatically captures this initial timestamp and begins tracking elapsed time toward the eventual resolution.

Support staff receive notification of the new incident and perform initial triage to determine priority level, category, and appropriate assignment based on the nature of the reported issue and available technician expertise. This triage process ensures that incidents are routed to the most qualified resources while maintaining efficient workload distribution.

The assigned technician begins diagnostic activities to identify the root cause of the reported issue, utilizing available tools, documentation, and knowledge management resources to develop an appropriate resolution strategy. This investigation phase may involve gathering additional information from the customer, reviewing system logs, or consulting with subject matter experts.

Implementation of the identified solution occurs through direct system changes, configuration updates, software installations, or guided customer actions, depending on the nature of the incident and organizational policies regarding remote access and customer self-service capabilities. The technician documents all actions taken and verifies that the implemented solution addresses the reported issue completely.

Customer verification and acceptance of the resolution ensures that the implemented solution meets their requirements and that no additional issues have been introduced during the resolution process. This verification step may involve testing, user acceptance, or simply confirmation that the original problem no longer exists.

Final ticket closure occurs when all resolution activities are complete, customer acceptance has been obtained, and all required documentation has been updated in the incident management system. The closure timestamp enables calculation of the total resolution time for inclusion in average resolution time metrics.

**Example Workflow**: A user reports email connectivity issues at 9:00 AM → Ticket created and assigned to Level 1 support at 9:05 AM → Initial troubleshooting identifies server configuration issue at 9:30 AM → Escalation to Level 2 support at 9:45 AM → Server configuration corrected at 11:15 AM → User confirms email functionality restored at 11:30 AM → Ticket closed at 11:45 AM → Total resolution time: 2 hours 45 minutes.
