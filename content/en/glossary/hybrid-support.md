## What Is Hybrid Support?

Hybrid support is a customer service model that strategically integrates artificial intelligence (AI)—including chatbots, automation, and virtual assistants—with human agents to deliver seamless, efficient, and customer-centric experiences. This approach leverages the rapid response, scalability, and 24/7 availability of AI while preserving human strengths in empathy, critical thinking, and nuanced judgment.

<strong>Core Principle:</strong>Match each customer interaction with the most suitable resource—AI for efficiency, humans for complexity and empathy.

## Key Components

### AI and Automation Layer

| Capability | Description | Advantages |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| <strong>24/7 Availability</strong>| Always-on service without time constraints | No wait times outside business hours |

## How Hybrid Support Works

### Interaction Workflow

```
Customer Initiates Contact
    ↓
AI Agent Greets and Triages
    ↓
    ├─→ Simple Query → AI Resolves → Complete
    │
    └─→ Complex/Emotional Query
            ↓
        Sentiment & Intent Analysis
            ↓
        Escalation Decision
            ↓
        Human Agent with Full Context
            ↓
        Resolution with AI Assistance
            ↓
        Follow-up (AI or Human)
```

### Escalation Triggers

<strong>Automated Escalation Criteria:</strong>| Trigger Type | Indicators | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| <strong>Sentiment</strong>| Negative language, frustration, anger | "This is ridiculous!" |
| <strong>Complexity</strong>| Multi-step issues, policy exceptions | "I need refund AND exchange AND..." |
| <strong>Uncertainty</strong>| Low AI confidence score | AI unsure of correct response |
| <strong>Request Type</strong>| Explicit human request | "Let me speak to a person" |
| <strong>Value</strong>| High-value customer identification | VIP account flag |
| <strong>Loops</strong>| Repeated unsuccessful attempts | Same query after 3 AI responses |

### Context Handoff Protocol

<strong>Information Transfer:</strong>| Data Element | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| <strong>Conversation History</strong>| Complete transcript |
| <strong>User Profile</strong>| Account details, purchase history, preferences |
| <strong>Intent Classification</strong>| Identified query purpose |
| <strong>Sentiment Score</strong>| Emotional state assessment |
| <strong>Previous Interactions</strong>| Historical context |
| <strong>AI Attempted Solutions</strong>| What was already tried |

<strong>Critical Success Factor:</strong>Customers should never need to repeat themselves.

## Use Cases and Applications

### Customer Service and Support

<strong>AI Handles:</strong>| Task | Volume | Complexity |
|------|--------|------------|
| Password resets | Very High | Low |
| Order tracking | High | Low |
| Business hours inquiry | High | Very Low |
| Return status | Medium | Low |
| Account balance | High | Low |

<strong>Humans Handle:</strong>| Task | Volume | Complexity |
|------|--------|------------|
| Billing disputes | Medium | High |
| Technical troubleshooting | Medium | Very High |
| Policy exceptions | Low | Very High |
| Complaints | Medium | High |
| Account compromises | Low | Critical |

<strong>Example Flow:</strong>```
Customer: "I need help with my recent order"
AI: "I can help! Please provide your order number."
Customer: [Provides number]
AI: [Retrieves status] "Your order shipped yesterday, arriving tomorrow."
Customer: "But I need it today! This is urgent!"
AI: [Detects urgency + frustration] → Escalates to human
Human Agent: [Reviews context] "I understand the urgency. Let me see 
             what we can do to expedite delivery..."
```
