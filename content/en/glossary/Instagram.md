## What Is Instagram?

Instagram is a visual-first social media platform focused on photo and video sharing, connecting over 2 billion monthly active users worldwide. Launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram revolutionized mobile photography and social media by emphasizing visual storytelling, creative expression, and community building through images and short videos. The platform combines social networking, content discovery, e-commerce, and messaging features within a mobile-first experience optimized for visual content consumption and creation.

<strong>Related:</strong>Instagram is owned by Meta Platforms Inc. (formerly Facebook Inc.), acquired in 2012 for $1 billion. For information about Meta's corporate structure and other products including Facebook and WhatsApp, see Meta.

Instagram's distinctive features include the main feed for permanent posts, Stories for ephemeral 24-hour content, Reels for short-form viral videos, IGTV for long-form content, Shopping for product discovery and purchases, and Direct Messaging for private conversations. The platform's algorithm curates personalized content feeds based on user interests, engagement patterns, and social connections, while the Explore page surfaces trending content and new accounts aligned with individual preferences. Instagram has become essential infrastructure for influencer marketing, brand building, creative expression, and visual commerce across industries.

The platform's influence extends beyond personal networking into professional domains including fashion, beauty, food, travel, art, photography, fitness, and entrepreneurship. Instagram's visual emphasis and younger demographic skew make it particularly effective for lifestyle brands, visual products, and businesses targeting millennials and Gen Z consumers. With features like Instagram Shopping, Creator Marketplace, and subscription content, the platform continues evolving as comprehensive ecosystem supporting creators, businesses, and communities through visual storytelling.
