## What Is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an advanced conversational AI assistant developed by OpenAI that uses large language models (LLMs) to engage in natural, human-like conversations. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT quickly became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users within two months. The system can understand context, generate creative content, answer questions, assist with coding, analyze documents, and perform a wide variety of language-based tasks through simple text prompts.

ChatGPT represents a significant evolution in human-computer interaction, moving beyond traditional keyword-based systems to truly conversational interfaces. The assistant leverages the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, specifically designed to predict and generate coherent, contextually appropriate text. Unlike rule-based chatbots that follow predetermined scripts, ChatGPT uses probabilistic language modeling to generate responses dynamically, enabling it to handle open-ended questions, creative tasks, and complex reasoning across virtually unlimited topics.

The current ChatGPT implementation features intelligent routing between multiple GPT models depending on task complexity. Simple queries receive near-instant responses from faster models, while complex reasoning, mathematical problems, or coding tasks automatically engage deeper "thinking" models that spend more time analyzing the problem before generating solutions. This hybrid approach balances speed and capability, providing optimal performance across diverse use cases.
