## What is a Customer Health Score?

A Customer Health Score is a quantitative metric that measures the overall well-being and likelihood of success for individual customers or accounts within a business relationship. This composite score aggregates multiple data points and behavioral indicators to provide a single, actionable measurement that predicts customer satisfaction, retention probability, and potential for expansion. Customer Health Scores serve as an early warning system for customer success teams, enabling proactive intervention before issues escalate to churn or contract non-renewal.

The concept of Customer Health Scoring emerged from the growing recognition that traditional lagging indicators, such as support tickets or payment delays, were insufficient for predicting customer outcomes. Modern health scoring systems incorporate leading indicators including product usage patterns, engagement levels, feature adoption rates, and relationship strength metrics. These scores typically range from 0-100 or use color-coded systems (red, yellow, green) to provide immediate visual understanding of account status. The methodology combines quantitative data from various touchpoints with qualitative assessments from customer-facing teams to create a comprehensive view of customer trajectory.

Customer Health Scores have become essential tools in the subscription economy and B2B SaaS environments, where customer lifetime value significantly exceeds acquisition costs. Organizations use these scores to prioritize customer success resources, identify expansion opportunities, and implement targeted retention strategies. The scoring framework must be continuously refined based on historical outcomes and changing business dynamics. Successful implementation requires cross-functional collaboration between customer success, sales, marketing, and product teams to ensure all relevant data sources are captured and weighted appropriately. The ultimate goal is to transform reactive customer management into a proactive, data-driven approach that maximizes customer outcomes and business growth.

## Core Health Scoring Components

**Usage Metrics** track how actively customers engage with the product or service, including login frequency, feature utilization, and depth of adoption. These behavioral indicators often serve as the strongest predictors of customer satisfaction and retention likelihood.

**Engagement Indicators** measure the quality and frequency of interactions between customers and the organization, encompassing support interactions, training participation, community involvement, and response rates to communications.

**Business Outcomes** assess whether customers are achieving their desired results and realizing value from the solution, often measured through goal attainment, ROI metrics, and success milestone completion.

**Relationship Health** evaluates the strength of interpersonal connections between customer stakeholders and the vendor team, including executive sponsorship, champion identification, and overall sentiment indicators.

**Financial Health** examines payment history, contract compliance, budget allocation, and financial stability indicators that may impact the customer's ability to continue or expand the relationship.

**Support Patterns** analyze the volume, severity, and resolution trends of customer support requests to identify potential satisfaction issues or technical challenges that could impact retention.

**Adoption Velocity** measures how quickly customers progress through onboarding milestones and achieve key adoption benchmarks compared to successful customer cohorts.

## How Customer Health Score Works

The Customer Health Score process begins with **data collection** from multiple sources including CRM systems, product analytics platforms, support ticketing systems, financial records, and direct customer feedback.
