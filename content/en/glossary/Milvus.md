## Definition: What Is Milvus?

Milvus is an open-source, cloud-native vector database purpose-built for scalable, high-performance similarity search on massive unstructured datasets. Developed by [Zilliz](https://zilliz.com/) and governed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/master/LICENSE), Milvus efficiently stores, indexes, and queries high-dimensional vector embeddings—numerical representations of data generated by AI and machine learning models. It is designed for elastic scaling, from laptop prototyping to enterprise production deployments managing tens of billions of vectors across distributed architectures. Milvus powers applications in semantic search, recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), computer vision, and anomaly detection.

**Key Attributes:**
- Open-source under Apache 2.0
- Cloud-native, microservices-based architecture
- Handles high-throughput, low-latency similarity search at enterprise scale
- Integrates with modern AI/ML toolchains and frameworks
## Core Concepts

### Vector Embeddings

Vector embeddings are high-dimensional arrays (e.g., 128, 768, 4096 dimensions) that encode the semantic or structural information of unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio. Generated by embedding models like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings), [Hugging Face transformers](https://huggingface.co/), and other neural networks, they translate complex data into a format suitable for efficient mathematical comparison.

**Example:** The word “cat” could be `[0.18, -0.46, 0.72, ...]` in a 768-dimensional space. Two semantically similar texts or images will have embeddings located close to each other in this space.
### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data is data that does not adhere to a predefined schema or structure—such as free-form text, images, audio, or videos. Unlike relational data, unstructured data is hard to process and analyze with traditional databases. Vector embeddings represent this data as fixed-length vectors, enabling it to be indexed, searched, and retrieved efficiently.

**Relevance to Milvus:** Milvus stores embeddings of unstructured data, enabling fast and accurate retrieval and analytics not feasible with conventional systems.

### Similarity Search & ANN

- **Similarity Search:** Finds items in a dataset most similar to a query item, based on vector distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, [cosine similarity](/en/glossary/cosine-similarity/), inner product).
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):** Family of algorithms that rapidly retrieve items whose vectors are closest to the query vector, trading a small amount of accuracy for significant speed gains—essential for billion-scale datasets.
## Milvus Architecture & Deployment Models

### System Overview

Milvus implements a **multi-layered, microservices-based architecture** with disaggregated storage and compute. Its design follows a data plane and control plane separation, promoting independent scalability and operational flexibility.

**Major Architectural Components** ([Milvus Architecture Overview](https://milvus.io/docs/architecture_overview.md)):
- **Access Layer:** Stateless proxies handling client requests and APIs (RESTful, SDKs), validating requests, and aggregating results.
- **Coordinator Services:** The logical "brain," orchestrates load balancing, metadata management, system state, DDL/DCL operations, and task scheduling.
- **Worker Nodes:** Stateless executors for search, data insertion, and indexing.  
    - *Streaming Node*: Handles real-time data ingestion and streaming consistency.  
    - *Query Node*: Loads and queries historical (sealed) data.  
    - *Data Node*: Handles background tasks like compaction and index-building.
- **Object Storage Layer:** Persists vector data, indexes, and logs. Supports MinIO, AWS S3, Azure Blob, and more.
- **Meta Storage:** Uses etcd for metadata and cluster state.
- **WAL Storage:** Write-Ahead Log for data durability and recovery (e.g., Woodpecker, Kafka, Pulsar).

**Data Flow Example:**  
- Search requests are routed from the client → access proxy → streaming/query nodes → results aggregated and returned.
- Insertions go through streaming nodes, written to WAL, converted to sealed segments, indexed, and stored.
