## What is Milvus?

Milvus is an open-source, cloud-native vector database purpose-built for scalable, high-performance similarity search on massive unstructured datasets. Developed by Zilliz and governed under the Apache 2.0 license, Milvus efficiently stores, indexes, and queries high-dimensional vector embeddings—numerical representations of data generated by AI and machine learning models.

The platform is designed for elastic scaling from laptop prototyping to enterprise production deployments managing tens of billions of vectors across distributed architectures. Milvus powers applications in semantic search, recommendation systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), computer vision, and anomaly detection—enabling organizations to build AI applications requiring fast, accurate similarity search on unstructured data.

## Core Concepts

### Vector Embeddings

High-dimensional arrays (e.g., 128, 768, 4096 dimensions) encoding semantic or structural information of unstructured data including text, images, and audio. Generated by embedding models like OpenAI, Hugging Face transformers, and other neural networks, embeddings translate complex data into format suitable for efficient mathematical comparison.

Semantically similar items have embeddings located close together in high-dimensional space, enabling similarity search through distance calculations.

### Unstructured Data

Data without predefined schema or structure—free-form text, images, audio, videos. Unlike relational data, unstructured data is difficult to process and analyze with traditional databases. Vector embeddings represent this data as fixed-length vectors enabling efficient indexing, search, and retrieval.

### Similarity Search and ANN

**Similarity Search:**Finding items in dataset most similar to query item based on vector distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine similarity, inner product).

**Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):**Family of algorithms rapidly retrieving items whose vectors are closest to query vector, trading small amount of accuracy for significant speed gains—essential for billion-scale datasets.

## Architecture

### Microservices-Based Design

Milvus implements multi-layered, microservices architecture with disaggregated storage and compute. Design follows data plane and control plane separation promoting independent scalability and operational flexibility.

**Major Components:**

**Access Layer:**Stateless proxies handling client requests and APIs (RESTful, SDKs), validating requests, aggregating results.

**Coordinator Services:**Orchestrates load balancing, metadata management, system state, DDL/DCL operations, task scheduling.

**Worker Nodes:**Stateless executors for search, data insertion, indexing.
- Streaming Node: Handles real-time data ingestion and streaming consistency
- Query Node: Loads and queries historical (sealed) data
- Data Node: Background tasks like compaction and index-building

**Object Storage:**Persists vector data, indexes, logs. Supports MinIO, AWS S3, Azure Blob.

**Meta Storage:**Uses etcd for metadata and cluster state.

**WAL Storage:**Write-Ahead Log for data durability and recovery (Kafka, Pulsar).

### Deployment Options

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Milvus Lite**| Python library via pip; runs embedded | Prototyping, local dev |
| **Standalone**| Docker-based single-node deployment | Testing, small production |
| **Distributed**| Kubernetes-based with horizontal scaling | Enterprise, large-scale |
| **Zilliz Cloud**| Fully managed SaaS with 10x performance acceleration | Production, hassle-free |

### Scalability

**Horizontal Scaling:**Compute and storage scale independently. Stateless microservices allow elastic recovery orchestrated by Kubernetes.

**Hardware Optimization:**AVX512, SIMD, GPU acceleration (NVIDIA CUDA, Cagra), NVMe SSD support.

**Billion-Scale Support:**Proven stability for datasets with tens of billions of vectors used in production by major enterprises.

## Key Features

### Supported Data Types

**Dense Vectors:**float32, float16, int8 arrays (from BERT, CLIP, ResNet).

**Sparse Vectors:**Efficient for high-dimensional data with many zeros (text search, recommendation).

**Binary Vectors:**Compact, bit-packed representation for hashing or vision tasks.

**Primitives:**Integer, float, string, boolean.

**JSON/Array/Set:**Semi-structured metadata and multi-modal modeling.

### Indexing Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **HNSW**| Hierarchical Navigable Small World; graph-based | Versatile, high-dimension |
| **IVF**| Inverted File System; partitions vector space | Balanced speed/cost |
| **DiskANN**| On-disk index for massive datasets | Billions of vectors, SSD |
| **Flat**| Linear scan for highest precision | Small datasets, evaluation |
| **Cagra**| GPU-optimized graph-based index | High-throughput, GPU infra |

**Key Concepts:**- Graph-based indexes (HNSW) outperform IVF for low-k, high recall queries
- IVF optimal for large top-k queries
- DiskANN ideal for SSD-backed, billion-scale datasets
- Quantization (SQ8, PQ) compresses vectors for memory efficiency

### Search Capabilities

**ANN Search:**Find top-K vectors most similar to query.

**Filtering Search:**Combine vector search with metadata filtering (tags, ranges).

**Range Search:**Retrieve vectors within distance threshold.

**Hybrid Search:**Use multiple vector fields/modalities in query.

**Full-Text Search:**BM25-based search for textual fields.

**Reranking:**Refine initial results with secondary algorithms.

**Fetch by ID:**Retrieve items by primary key or complex expressions.

### Data Operations

**Collections & Partitions:**Organize data hierarchically for efficient access.

**Schema Evolution:**Update collection schemas without downtime.

**CRUD Operations:**Insert, update, delete, upsert vectors and metadata.

**Batch Processing:**Bulk import/export tools.

**Multi-Tenancy:**Isolation by database, collection, or partition key.

### Consistency and Security

**Configurable Consistency:**Strong, bounded staleness, session, eventual consistency models.

**Authentication & RBAC:**User authentication, role-based access control, fine-grained permissions.

**TLS Encryption:**Secure data-in-transit.

**Tiered Storage:**Hot/cold storage for cost-efficient performance.
