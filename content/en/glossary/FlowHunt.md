## What is FlowHunt?

FlowHunt is a no-code AI chatbot and automation platform enabling users to build, deploy, and manage intelligent conversational agents and multi-agent workflows without programming. Through visual drag-and-drop interfaces, FlowHunt connects AI models, knowledge sources, and business systems to create sophisticated automation sequences (Flows) that handle customer service, lead generation, content summarization, and complex multi-step processes.

The platform supports multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini), integrates with knowledge repositories (websites, documents, databases), and provides native connections to business tools (CRM, helpdesk, e-commerce platforms). FlowHunt enables rapid deployment of chatbots across websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms through simple integration scripts or embeddable widgets.

## Core Concepts

**Flow**Self-contained automation sequence or workflow defined by connected components. Each flow functions as chatbot, AI assistant, or multi-agent system performing varied tasks.

- Visual drag-and-drop builder connects functional blocks without programming
- Blocks represent input, processing, knowledge retrieval, AI generation, or output
- Flows managed and deployed from unified dashboard
- Support branching logic, multi-agent orchestration, real-time validation

**Agent**Autonomous AI entity assigned specific task within flow. Agents collaborate by passing context, data, and instructions to achieve complex goals.

- Specialized for tasks: document retrieval, query expansion, summarization, customer support
- Configurable with different AI models per agent (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Access shared or isolated knowledge sources
- Chain agents, run in parallel, or conditionally trigger

**Knowledge Source**External or internal information repository connected to chatbot. Includes websites, uploaded documents (PDFs, DOCX), images, videos, databases, real-time web content.

- Indexed by built-in crawler or upload tools
- Scheduled content refreshes for currency
- Domain or page-level targeting
- Dynamic knowledge base updates
- API or database integration support

**Component**Functional block within Flow handling discrete tasks.

**Component Types:**- **Input**– Receives chat/user data
- **Retriever**– Searches knowledge sources
- **Generator**– Calls AI models to generate responses
- **Output**– Delivers chat replies
- **Scheduler**– Automates recurring tasks
- **API/Integration**– Connects external tools via REST/Webhooks

**Template**Pre-built flows or chatbot setups addressing common business scenarios (customer service, lead generation, content summarization).

- Pre-configured components and logic
- Customizable workflows, AI models, knowledge sources
- Accelerates deployment for non-technical users

**Integration Script**JavaScript code snippet generated for embedding chatbots onto websites, affiliate portals, or within banners.

- Placed in website footers or web applications
- Custom parameters for affiliate tracking
- Deep integration with existing UIs
- Instant deployment without backend changes

**Schedule**Automated task periodically indexing or updating connected knowledge sources.

- Configurable frequency (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Source type specification (entire website, specific URL, sitemap)
- Content type selection (text, documents, multimedia)
- Ensures chatbot information currency

**Banner Chatbot**FlowHunt chatbot deployed as web banner, often for affiliate or partner marketing.

- Customizable tracking parameters for attribution
- Dedicated integration script embedding
- Unique tracking codes for conversions and referrals

## Implementation Approach

**Planning Phase:**- Define objectives (cost reduction, satisfaction improvement, automation scope)
- Identify processes suitable for automation
- Map customer journey and touchpoints

**Build Phase:**- Select relevant templates or create custom flows
- Configure AI models for each agent
- Connect knowledge sources (upload documents, configure crawler)
- Set up integrations with business systems
- Customize branding and user experience

**Test Phase:**- Preview workflows and test chatbot responses
- Validate knowledge retrieval accuracy
- Test escalation and fallback scenarios
- Gather internal feedback before launch

**Deploy Phase:**- Generate integration scripts for target platforms

## Best Practices

**Start with Clear Objectives:**Define specific goals before building flows. Focus on measurable outcomes like response time reduction or conversion improvement.

**Leverage Pre-Built Templates:**Use proven templates as starting points. Customize rather than building from scratch to accelerate deployment.

**Maintain Knowledge Currency:**Schedule regular knowledge source updates. Stale information undermines chatbot effectiveness.

**Test Thoroughly:**Preview and test flows extensively before public deployment. Cover edge cases and fallback scenarios.

**Monitor and Iterate:**Regular analytics review identifies improvement opportunities. Continuous refinement ensures ongoing value.

**Design for Escalation:**Always provide clear paths to human support. Recognize chatbot limitations and hand off appropriately.

**Protect User Privacy:**Implement proper data handling and privacy controls. Comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

## Integration Examples

**Website Embedding:**Add chat widget to website footer using generated script. Customize appearance to match site design.

**Affiliate Marketing:**Deploy banner chatbots with tracking parameters. Monitor conversion attribution and optimize for referral revenue.

**CRM Connection:**Sync captured leads directly to HubSpot or Salesforce. Automatic record creation from chatbot interactions.

**E-commerce Platform:**Connect to Shopify or Magento for real-time inventory queries. Process orders or returns through chatbot interface.

**Communication Tools:**Integrate with Slack or LiveAgent for internal support automation. Route complex issues to appropriate channels.

## Advantages
