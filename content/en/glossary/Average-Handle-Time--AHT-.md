## What is an Average Handle Time (AHT)?

Average Handle Time (AHT) is a fundamental key performance indicator (KPI) used in contact centers and customer service operations to measure the total time an agent spends handling a customer interaction from start to finish. This metric encompasses not only the actual conversation time with the customer but also includes any hold time during the call and the after-call work (ACW) time required to complete tasks related to that specific interaction. AHT serves as a critical benchmark for operational efficiency, resource planning, and service quality assessment in customer service environments.

The calculation of AHT involves dividing the total handle time for all interactions by the number of interactions handled during a specific period. This comprehensive measurement provides managers and analysts with valuable insights into agent productivity, process efficiency, and overall contact center performance. Unlike simple talk time metrics, AHT captures the complete customer service experience, making it an essential tool for understanding the true cost and complexity of customer interactions across various channels including voice calls, chat sessions, email responses, and social media interactions.

Understanding and optimizing AHT is crucial for contact center success because it directly impacts both operational costs and customer satisfaction levels. While shorter handle times can indicate efficient problem resolution and lower operational expenses, excessively low AHT may suggest rushed interactions that compromise service quality. Conversely, longer handle times might indicate thorough customer service but could also signal inefficiencies, inadequate training, or complex processes that need streamlining. The key lies in finding the optimal balance that ensures high-quality customer service while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## Core Contact Center Performance Components

**Talk Time**- The actual duration of active conversation between the agent and customer, representing the primary interaction period where information exchange, problem-solving, and relationship building occur. This component typically forms the largest portion of AHT.

**Hold Time**- The cumulative time customers spend on hold during an interaction while agents research information, consult supervisors, or perform system lookups. Minimizing hold time is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and reducing overall AHT.

**After-Call Work (ACW)**- The time agents spend completing interaction-related tasks after the customer has disconnected, including updating customer records, scheduling follow-ups, and processing orders. ACW is essential for data accuracy but should be optimized for efficiency.

**Wrap-Up Time**- A specific subset of ACW that involves categorizing the interaction, updating case status, and preparing for the next customer contact. Proper wrap-up procedures ensure continuity and quality in customer service delivery.

**System Response Time**- The delays caused by technology infrastructure, including CRM loading times, database queries, and application switching. These technical factors significantly impact AHT and require ongoing monitoring and optimization.

**Transfer Time**- The duration involved in transferring customers to other departments or specialists, including explanation time and warm transfer procedures. Reducing unnecessary transfers is key to AHT optimization.

**Multi-Channel Integration Time**- The additional time required when agents handle interactions across multiple channels simultaneously or need to reference previous interactions from different communication channels.

## How Average Handle Time (AHT) Works

The AHT measurement process begins when a customer interaction is initiated and continues until all related work is completed. Here's the detailed workflow:

1. **Interaction Initiation**- The timer starts when an agent accepts an incoming call, chat, or begins working on an email/ticket, marking the official beginning of the handle time measurement.

2. **Customer Authentication and Issue Identification**- Agents verify customer identity, access relevant account information, and determine the nature of the customer's inquiry or problem, establishing the foundation for efficient resolution.

3. **Active Problem Resolution**- The core interaction phase where agents provide information, troubleshoot issues, process requests, or guide customers through solutions while maintaining professional communication standards.

4. **Hold and Research Periods**- When necessary, agents place customers on hold to research complex issues, consult knowledge bases, or seek supervisor assistance, with all hold time contributing to the total AHT calculation.

5. **Solution Implementation and Verification**- Agents implement solutions, process transactions, or provide final answers while confirming customer understanding and satisfaction with the resolution provided.

6. **Interaction Closure**- The conversation concludes with appropriate closing procedures, including summarizing actions taken, setting expectations for follow-up, and ensuring customer satisfaction before disconnection.

7. **After-Call Work Completion**- Agents update customer records, categorize the interaction, schedule follow-up activities, and complete any administrative tasks directly related to the customer interaction.

8. **Quality Assurance Documentation**- Final documentation and case closure activities that ensure proper record-keeping and enable future reference for the customer's interaction history.

**Example Workflow**: A technical support call begins at 10:00 AM with customer authentication (2 minutes), problem diagnosis (5 minutes), hold time for research (3 minutes), solution implementation (8 minutes), and after-call work (4 minutes), resulting in a total AHT of 22 minutes.
