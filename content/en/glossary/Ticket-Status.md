## What is Ticket Status?

Ticket status represents the current state or condition of a support request, incident, or work item within a ticketing system. It serves as a fundamental tracking mechanism that provides visibility into where a particular issue stands in the resolution process. The ticket status acts as a communication bridge between customers, support agents, and management teams, ensuring everyone understands the current progress and next steps required for resolution.

In modern IT service management (ITSM) and help desk environments, ticket status functions as the backbone of workflow orchestration. Each status represents a specific stage in the ticket lifecycle, from initial creation through final closure. The status system enables organizations to maintain accountability, track performance metrics, and ensure that no requests fall through the cracks. Different status values trigger specific actions, notifications, and escalation procedures, creating an automated workflow that guides tickets through their resolution journey.

The evolution of ticket status systems has transformed from simple binary states like "open" and "closed" to sophisticated multi-dimensional frameworks that capture nuanced information about ticket progress. Modern implementations incorporate automated status transitions, conditional logic, and integration with external systems to create seamless workflows. These advanced status systems support complex business processes, regulatory compliance requirements, and detailed reporting capabilities that drive continuous improvement in service delivery organizations.

## Core Ticket Status Components

<strong>Initial Status Categories</strong>- New tickets typically begin with statuses like "New," "Open," or "Submitted" to indicate they have entered the system but haven't been assigned or reviewed. These initial states trigger notification workflows and begin the formal tracking process.

<strong>Assignment and Ownership States</strong>- Statuses such as "Assigned," "In Progress," or "Under Investigation" indicate that a specific agent or team has taken responsibility for the ticket. These states often include timestamp tracking and ownership accountability mechanisms.

<strong>Customer Interaction States</strong>- Statuses like "Pending Customer Response," "Waiting for Information," or "Customer Review" indicate that the ticket requires input or action from the requestor. These states often include automatic reminder systems and escalation timers.

<strong>Resolution and Closure States</strong>- Final statuses including "Resolved," "Closed," "Completed," or "Cancelled" indicate that the ticket has reached its conclusion. These states trigger satisfaction surveys, documentation requirements, and performance metric calculations.

<strong>Escalation and Priority States</strong>- Special statuses such as "Escalated," "Critical," or "Management Review" indicate tickets requiring elevated attention or specialized handling procedures. These states activate enhanced notification protocols and expedited workflows.

<strong>Hold and Suspension States</strong>- Statuses like "On Hold," "Suspended," or "Waiting for Vendor" indicate temporary pauses in ticket processing due to external dependencies or resource constraints. These states preserve ticket context while managing queue priorities.

<strong>Review and Quality Assurance States</strong>- Advanced implementations include statuses for "Quality Review," "Approval Pending," or "Documentation Review" to ensure resolution quality and compliance with organizational standards.

## How Ticket Status Works

The ticket status workflow begins when a user submits a request through various channels including email, web portals, phone calls, or automated monitoring systems. The system automatically assigns an initial status, typically "New" or "Open," and generates a unique ticket identifier for tracking purposes.

Upon creation, the ticketing system evaluates predefined rules and criteria to determine appropriate routing and initial categorization. This process may involve automatic assignment based on keywords, requestor information, or service categories, with the status updating to reflect the assignment state.

A qualified agent or team member reviews the ticket details and accepts ownership, triggering a status change to "Assigned" or "In Progress." This transition often includes automatic notifications to stakeholders and begins formal service level agreement (SLA) tracking timers.

During the investigation and resolution phase, agents update the status to reflect current activities such as "Under Investigation," "Awaiting Parts," or "Testing Solution." Each status change creates an audit trail and may trigger specific workflows or notifications to keep stakeholders informed.

When agent action requires customer input or approval, the status changes to appropriate waiting states like "Pending Customer Response" or "Customer Review." These transitions often activate automatic reminder systems and pause SLA timers until customer engagement resumes.

Upon resolution completion, agents update the status to "Resolved" or "Fixed," which typically triggers customer notification and satisfaction survey processes. The ticket may remain in this state for a specified period to allow customer feedback or issue recurrence.

Final closure occurs when the customer confirms satisfaction or after a predetermined waiting period, changing the status to "Closed." This transition activates final reporting processes, archives ticket data, and completes performance metric calculations.

Throughout this workflow, automated escalation procedures monitor status duration and trigger alerts or status changes when predefined thresholds are exceeded, ensuring timely resolution and appropriate management visibility.

<strong>Example Workflow:</strong>1. Customer submits request → Status: "New"
2. System routes to appropriate team → Status: "Assigned"
3. Agent begins work → Status: "In Progress"
4. Agent requests customer information → Status: "Pending Customer"
5. Customer provides details → Status: "In Progress"
6. Agent implements solution → Status: "Resolved"
7. Customer confirms satisfaction → Status: "Closed"
