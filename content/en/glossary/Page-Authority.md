## What is a Page Authority?

Page Authority (PA) is a search engine optimization metric developed by Moz that predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engine result pages (SERPs). This proprietary score ranges from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of ranking well in search results. Unlike Domain Authority, which measures the overall strength of an entire domain, Page Authority focuses specifically on the ranking potential of individual web pages. The metric serves as a comparative tool that helps SEO professionals, digital marketers, and website owners understand the relative strength of their pages against competitors in the same niche or industry.

The calculation of Page Authority involves a complex machine learning algorithm that evaluates numerous factors, with link data being the primary component. Moz's algorithm analyzes both the quantity and quality of links pointing to a specific page, considering factors such as the authority of linking domains, the relevance of linking content, and the overall link profile structure. The metric also incorporates on-page elements, social signals, and other ranking factors that search engines typically consider when determining page rankings. It's important to note that Page Authority is updated regularly as Moz's web index grows and the algorithm becomes more sophisticated, which means scores can fluctuate over time as new data becomes available.

Page Authority serves as a valuable benchmarking tool rather than an absolute measure of ranking success. Since search engine algorithms are proprietary and constantly evolving, no third-party metric can perfectly predict rankings. However, Page Authority provides useful insights for competitive analysis, link building prioritization, and overall SEO strategy development. The metric helps identify which pages have the strongest potential to rank well, allowing marketers to focus their optimization efforts on pages with the highest authority or identify opportunities to improve weaker pages. Understanding Page Authority enables more informed decisions about content strategy, internal linking structures, and external link acquisition efforts.

## Core Page Authority Components

**Link Equity Distribution**- The way link authority flows through a website's internal structure significantly impacts individual page authority scores. Pages that receive more internal links from high-authority pages within the same domain typically develop stronger Page Authority scores.

**External Link Quality**- The authority and relevance of external websites linking to a specific page directly influence its Page Authority score. Links from high-domain authority sites in related niches carry more weight than links from low-authority or unrelated sources.

**Content Relevance Signals**- The topical relevance and semantic relationship between linking content and target pages affect Page Authority calculations. Search engines evaluate contextual relevance to determine the value of link relationships.

**Link Velocity Patterns**- The rate at which a page acquires new links over time impacts its authority development. Natural, consistent link growth patterns typically contribute more positively than sudden spikes or artificial link building activities.

**Social Engagement Metrics**- Social media shares, comments, and engagement signals provide additional context about page quality and user interest, contributing to overall Page Authority calculations through indirect ranking factors.

**Technical SEO Factors**- Page loading speed, mobile responsiveness, structured data implementation, and other technical elements influence how search engines evaluate page quality and authority potential.

**User Experience Indicators**- Metrics such as bounce rate, time on page, click-through rates, and user engagement patterns provide signals about page quality that contribute to authority calculations.

## How Page Authority Works

**Data Collection Phase**- Moz's web crawlers continuously scan the internet to discover and index web pages, collecting comprehensive data about link relationships, content quality, and technical characteristics across millions of websites and individual pages.

**Link Analysis Processing**- The algorithm analyzes the complete link graph surrounding each page, evaluating both inbound and outbound links while considering factors such as link placement, anchor text, and the authority of linking domains.

**Quality Assessment Evaluation**- Machine learning models assess the quality and relevance of links by examining the topical relationship between linking and target pages, the editorial context of links, and the overall trustworthiness of linking sources.

**Authority Score Calculation**- Complex mathematical models process all collected data points to generate a numerical score between 1 and 100, with logarithmic scaling that makes higher scores increasingly difficult to achieve.

**Comparative Ranking Analysis**- The algorithm compares pages within similar topics and industries to establish relative authority rankings, ensuring that scores reflect competitive positioning within relevant market segments.

**Regular Update Cycles**- Page Authority scores are recalculated periodically as new data becomes available, with updates occurring monthly or bi-monthly depending on the frequency of Moz's index refreshes.

**Example Workflow**: A technology blog post about artificial intelligence receives links from three sources: a university research page (high authority), a relevant industry publication (medium authority), and a personal blog (low authority). The algorithm evaluates each link's context, the linking page's own authority, and the relevance to AI topics, then combines these signals with internal linking patterns and user engagement data to calculate the page's overall authority score.
