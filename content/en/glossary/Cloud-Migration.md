## What is a Cloud Migration?

Cloud migration refers to the comprehensive process of moving an organization's digital assets, applications, data, and IT infrastructure from on-premises environments or legacy systems to cloud computing platforms. This strategic initiative represents a fundamental shift in how businesses manage their technology resources, transitioning from traditional physical hardware and software deployments to scalable, flexible, and cost-effective cloud-based solutions. The migration process encompasses not only the technical transfer of systems but also the transformation of operational processes, security frameworks, and organizational workflows to leverage the full potential of cloud computing capabilities.

The scope of cloud migration extends far beyond simple data transfer, involving careful planning, assessment, and execution of complex technical and business requirements. Organizations typically migrate various components including databases, applications, virtual machines, storage systems, networking configurations, and security protocols. The process requires thorough analysis of existing infrastructure dependencies, performance requirements, compliance obligations, and business continuity needs. Modern cloud migration strategies often involve hybrid approaches, where organizations maintain certain systems on-premises while moving others to public, private, or multi-cloud environments based on specific operational requirements and strategic objectives.

Cloud migration has become a critical component of digital transformation initiatives, enabling organizations to modernize their IT infrastructure, improve operational efficiency, and enhance their competitive positioning in rapidly evolving markets. The migration journey typically involves multiple phases including discovery and assessment, planning and design, migration execution, optimization, and ongoing management. Success depends on careful consideration of factors such as application architecture, data sensitivity, regulatory compliance, user experience requirements, and long-term business goals. Organizations must also address cultural and organizational changes, as cloud adoption often requires new skills, processes, and ways of working that differ significantly from traditional IT operations.

## Core Migration Strategies

**Rehosting (Lift and Shift)** involves moving applications and data to the cloud with minimal modifications to the existing architecture. This approach provides quick migration benefits while maintaining familiar operational processes, though it may not fully leverage cloud-native capabilities and cost optimization opportunities.

**Replatforming (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)** includes making selective optimizations during the migration process without changing the core application architecture. Organizations typically update database engines, operating systems, or middleware components to better align with cloud platform capabilities while preserving application functionality.

**Refactoring (Re-architecting)** represents a comprehensive approach that involves redesigning applications to take full advantage of cloud-native features and services. This strategy requires significant development effort but delivers maximum benefits in terms of scalability, performance, and cost optimization.

**Repurchasing (Drop and Shop)** involves replacing existing applications with cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions that provide similar functionality. This approach eliminates maintenance overhead while potentially requiring process changes and user training.

**Retiring** focuses on identifying and decommissioning applications that are no longer needed or provide minimal business value. This strategy reduces migration complexity and ongoing operational costs by eliminating unnecessary system dependencies.

**Retaining (Revisiting)** involves keeping certain applications in their current environment due to regulatory requirements, technical constraints, or business considerations. These systems may be candidates for future migration as cloud capabilities evolve or business requirements change.

## How Cloud Migration Works
