## What Is Gemini?

Gemini is [Google](Google.md)'s advanced family of multimodal AI models developed by Google DeepMind, designed to understand and process information across text, images, audio, video, and code simultaneously. Launched in December 2023, Gemini represents Google's unified approach to artificial intelligence, replacing earlier separate systems with integrated models capable of native multimodal reasoning. The latest generation, Gemini 2.5 Pro, delivers state-of-the-art performance across reasoning, coding, mathematics, and multimodal understanding tasks.

**Related:** For comprehensive information about Google's AI strategy, Vertex AI platform, and full product ecosystem including AlphaFold and Imagen, see [Google](Google.md).

Unlike traditional language models designed primarily for text, Gemini is built from the ground up to process and generate content across multiple modalities. This native multimodal architecture enables Gemini to analyze images while reading text, understand audio in context with visual information, and generate responses that synthesize insights from diverse data types. The model family spans from lightweight variants for edge devices to ultra-capable versions for complex enterprise applications and scientific research.

Gemini powers Google's consumer products including the Gemini chatbot (formerly Bard), Google Search enhancements, Workspace productivity features, and Android device capabilities. Through Vertex AI, enterprises access Gemini models via APIs, enabling custom AI applications, chatbot development, data analysis, and workflow automation. The combination of Google's computational infrastructure, comprehensive training data, and decades of AI research positions Gemini as a leading choice for organizations requiring robust, scalable multimodal AI capabilities.
