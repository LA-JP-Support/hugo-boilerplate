## Company Background and History

**DeepMind Origins (2010-2014)**

DeepMind was founded in London in September 2010 by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa Suleyman. The founders shared a vision of solving intelligence and using it to advance scientific discovery. Hassabis, a chess prodigy and video game designer who earned a PhD in cognitive neuroscience, brought a unique interdisciplinary perspective combining neuroscience insights with cutting-edge machine learning.

The company quickly established itself as a leader in deep reinforcement learning, developing systems that learned to play Atari games at superhuman levels directly from pixel inputs. This work demonstrated the potential of general learning algorithms and attracted significant attention from the AI research community.

**Google Acquisition (2014)**

In January 2014, Google acquired DeepMind for approximately $500 million, one of the largest AI acquisitions at the time. DeepMind retained significant operational independence, continuing to operate from London under Hassabis's leadership while gaining access to Google's vast computational resources and data infrastructure.

- **2023:** Gemini model family launched
- **2024:** Nobel Prize in Chemistry for AlphaFold team
- **2024:** Gemini 2.0 and advanced capabilities released

**Google Brain Origins and Merger**

Google Brain was established in 2011 as a deep learning research project within Google, led by Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean. The team made foundational contributions including the development of TensorFlow, the Transformer architecture that underlies modern LLMs, and numerous advances in neural network training and optimization.

In April 2023, Google merged DeepMind and Google Brain into a unified organization called Google DeepMind, combining the strengths of both teams under Demis Hassabis's leadership to accelerate AI progress and compete more effectively with rivals like [OpenAI](OpenAI.md) and [Anthropic](Anthropic.md).
