## What Is a Confidence Threshold?

A **confidence threshold** is a configurable cutoff value controlling whether a machine learning model’s prediction is accepted as reliable for downstream action, or discarded, flagged, or escalated for further review. Every prediction generated by an AI model is typically accompanied by a **confidence score**—a numeric value (commonly between 0 and 1, or 0% to 100%) indicating the model’s level of certainty in its prediction. The threshold acts as a filter: **only predictions with a confidence score equal to or exceeding this threshold are deemed trustworthy enough to act upon**.

For example, in fraud detection, if a model assigns a fraud score of 0.96 to a transaction and the threshold is set to 0.95, the transaction is blocked. If the score is 0.90, the transaction may only be flagged for manual review.

## How Are Confidence Scores Calculated?

Confidence scores are generated by the output layer of a machine learning model and represent the model’s certainty regarding its prediction. The method for calculation depends on the model architecture and the specific task:

- **Softmax (multi-class classification):** Produces a probability distribution across all possible classes. For example, an image classifier might output `[cat: 0.92, dog: 0.06, rabbit: 0.02]`—the model is 92% confident the image contains a cat.
- **Sigmoid (binary classification):** Outputs a probability (0–1) that the input belongs to the positive class.
- **Logits:** Raw, unnormalized outputs from the model, typically transformed by activation functions (like softmax or sigmoid) into probabilities.

## Types of Confidence Scores

| Type                        | Range / Format         | Pros                                        | Cons                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Continuous (e.g., 0–1, 0–100%) | Decimal or percentage   | Intuitive, granular, mathematically robust   | Highest score ≠ always correct         |
| Logit (raw scores)          | -∞ to +∞               | Useful in advanced pipelines, fine-grained   | Not human-readable                     |
| Discrete (low/med/high)     | Categorical            | Simple for business rules, easy to explain   | Lacks granularity, not mathematically precise |

**Technical note:**  
Continuous and logit scores can be converted using sigmoid or softmax functions, but precision may be affected by floating point limits ([Mindee](https://www.mindee.com/blog/how-use-confidence-scores-ml-models)).


## Why Do Confidence Thresholds Matter?

### Business and Safety Implications

- **Risk Management:** In banking, healthcare, or autonomous vehicles, the cost of a wrong prediction can be severe—such as approving a fraudulent transaction, misdiagnosing a patient, or failing to recognize an obstacle.
- **Operational Efficiency:** E-commerce recommendation systems with high-threshold settings increase conversions by only showing items with high confidence, while lower confidence recommendations may annoy users.
- **Automation vs. Human Review:** Thresholds determine when to automate versus when to escalate to human operators for further decision-making ([Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8357749625498-About-confidence-thresholds-for-advanced-AI-agents)).

**Analogy:** A model’s high confidence score signals readiness to take action, much like a human expressing certainty before making a decision. The threshold is the standard of certainty required before acting.


## Distinguishing Confidence, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall

| Metric     | What It Measures                                    | Example Use           | Formula                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Confidence | Certainty about *this* prediction                   | “This is a cat: 92%”  | Model output per instance        |
| Accuracy   | Overall correctness across all predictions          | “Model is 90% accurate on test set” | (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) |
| Precision  | % of positive predictions that are actually correct | Minimize false alarms | TP / (TP + FP)                  |
| Recall     | % of actual positives correctly identified          | Avoid missing events  | TP / (TP + FN)                  |

- **TP:** True Positives  
- **FP:** False Positives  
- **TN:** True Negatives  
- **FN:** False Negatives

**Key:**  
Raising the threshold increases precision (fewer false positives) but may lower recall (more missed positives). Lowering the threshold does the opposite.

## How to Set and Tune Confidence Thresholds

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Analyze Data Distribution**
   - Visualize model confidence scores (e.g., histogram of outputs).
   - Identify natural cutoffs or clusters.

2. **Establish Initial Threshold**
   - Start with a standard (e.g., 0.5 for binary classification).
   - For high-risk domains, start higher (e.g., 0.9).

3. **Test and Iterate**
   - Evaluate [precision and recall](/en/glossary/precision-and-recall/) at various thresholds.
   - Use *Precision-Recall (PR) curves* to visualize trade-offs.
   - Adjust based on business needs, risk tolerance, or regulatory requirements.

4. **Monitor and Adapt**
   - Continuously monitor model performance.
   - Adjust threshold as data or business objectives change.

**Microsoft Learn** recommends choosing a threshold based on your desired balance between accuracy (raise the threshold for higher precision, lower coverage) and coverage (lower the threshold to answer more, but risk more false positives):

### Visualizing Threshold Effects: The Precision-Recall Curve

A **PR curve** plots precision vs. recall at multiple threshold values. It helps pick a threshold that balances priorities.

### Code Example: Applying a Confidence Threshold in Python

#### Computer Vision (Ultralytics YOLO)

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
# Only keep detections with confidence ≥ 0.6
results = model.predict("bus.jpg", conf=0.6)
print(f"Detected {len(results[0].boxes)} objects with high confidence.")
```
*Source: [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/confidence)*

#### General Binary Classification

```python
import numpy as np

def apply_confidence_threshold(predictions, threshold=0.7):
    return [1 if p >= threshold else 0 for p in predictions]

predictions = [0.82, 0.67, 0.91, 0.48]
labels = apply_confidence_threshold(predictions, threshold=0.8)
# Output: [1, 0, 1, 0]
```


## Real-World Applications & Examples

### Computer Vision

#### Manufacturing Defect Detection
- **Scenario:** Visual inspection model predicts a defect with 0.82 confidence.
- **Threshold:** Set at 0.80, the product is sent for manual inspection; below 0.80, it passes.
- **Trade-off:** Higher threshold = fewer false alarms, but risk missing real defects.

#### Object Detection for Safety
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Only obstacles detected with high confidence trigger braking. Low-confidence detections may be cross-validated with other sensors.

### Chatbots & AI Agents

#### Intent Matching (Zendesk)
- **Scenario:** Chatbot predicts user intent with confidence levels.
- **Threshold:** Default is 60% (0.6); most users prefer 50–70%.
- **Outcome:** At or above threshold, chatbot replies; below, it defaults or escalates.

### Document Processing

#### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- **Scenario:** AI extracts invoice dates with a confidence score.
- **Threshold:** Only dates with confidence above 0.85 are auto-filled; others flagged for review.

### Healthcare Diagnostics

- **Scenario:** AI flags X-ray anomalies with confidence scores.
- **Threshold:** High-confidence findings prioritized for urgent review; lower-confidence flagged for “second look.”

### Financial Services

#### Fraud Detection
- **Scenario:** Model scores transaction as 0.94 likely fraudulent.
- **Threshold:** Bank sets threshold at 0.95—transaction is allowed but flagged. If 0.97, block transaction and alert customer.


## Setting the Threshold: Trade-Offs

| Threshold Level      | Precision          | Recall               | Use Case Example                         |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Low (<0.5)           | Low                | High                 | Catch all possible defects (manufacturing) |
| Balanced (0.7–0.8)   | Moderate           | Moderate             | General recommendation engines           |
| High (>0.9)          | High               | Low                  | Medical diagnosis, fraud blocking        |

**Key insight:**  
- **Raising the threshold** reduces false positives (higher precision) but increases false negatives (lower recall).
- **Lowering the threshold** does the opposite.


## Best Practices, Pitfalls, and Considerations

### Best Practices
- **Calibrate Scores:** Use techniques like Platt scaling or isotonic regression to align confidence scores with real-world probabilities.
- **Monitor Continuously:** Data may drift; thresholds should be periodically reviewed.
- **Align with Business Context:** Choose thresholds reflecting the cost of errors in your domain.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Escalate borderline predictions for human review.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Setting Threshold Too High:** Can miss valid predictions (low recall), reducing coverage.
- **Setting Threshold Too Low:** Increases risk of acting on incorrect predictions (low precision).
- **Ignoring Calibration:** Poorly calibrated scores can lead to erroneous decisions.
- **Static Thresholds:** Failing to adjust as data, business needs, or model performance evolve.

### Special Considerations
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Some domains require auditable, explainable thresholds ([Iterate.ai](https://www.iterate.ai/ai-glossary/confident-thresholding)).
- **Class Imbalance:** Adjust thresholds for rare events (e.g., rare diseases, fraud).
- **Ensemble Models:** Often provide better-calibrated confidence estimates.


## Advanced: Beyond Confidence Thresholds

- **Multi-Step Validation:** In manufacturing, low-confidence detections may trigger additional inspection steps or alternative sensors.
- **Temporal/Contextual Analysis:** For time series or video, aggregate confidence across frames.
- **Hybrid Systems:** Combine AI predictions with rule-based checks for mission-critical applications.
