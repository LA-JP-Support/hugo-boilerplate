## What is CRM?

CRM, or Customer Relationship Management, is both a business strategy and a technology platform that empowers organizations to record, track, and manage every interaction with current and prospective customers. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, optimize retention, and streamline the processes that support these objectives.

CRM systems unify data across sales, marketing, customer service, and other departments, creating a single, 360-degree view of each customer. This enables organizations to deliver personalized and timely communications, anticipate needs, and resolve issues efficiently. CRM platforms are used by companies of all sizes and industries, including B2B, B2C, government, and non-profits.

According to industry research, the average company uses nearly 900 different applications, with only 29% integrated. CRM aims to connect these silos, centralizing customer data and avoiding fragmented information that hampers customer experience and business efficiency.

## How Does CRM Work?

CRM systems aggregate and organize customer data from multiple sources and channels:

**Data Sources:**
- Email, phone, chat, and SMS
- Web forms and website visits
- Social media interactions
- Purchase and transaction history
- Customer support tickets
- Marketing campaign engagement

This data is stored in a centralized platform, accessible to authorized users across the organization.

### Core CRM Processes

**Data Collection**  
Every customer touchpoint—sales calls, emails, support interactions, social media—is logged and associated with the customer's record.

**Data Integration**  
Information from disparate business systems (ERP, marketing automation, e-commerce, accounting) is unified into a comprehensive customer profile.

**Automation**  
Repetitive tasks such as lead assignment, follow-ups, appointment scheduling, and ticket routing are automated to increase efficiency and ensure timely response.

**Analytics and Reporting**  
CRM platforms analyze customer data to uncover trends, segment audiences, forecast sales, and measure performance of campaigns and teams.

**Collaboration**  
CRM fosters cross-functional collaboration, allowing sales, marketing, service, and support teams to share insights, coordinate actions, and deliver seamless customer experience.

### Example Scenario

A retail chain uses CRM to monitor purchase histories, service requests, and marketing responses. When a high-value customer submits a support inquiry, the system alerts the relevant agent and provides a complete profile, including past purchases and communications, enabling prompt and tailored service.

## Types of CRM

### Operational CRM
Focuses on automating and optimizing customer-facing business processes:
- **Sales Force Automation (SFA):** Manages leads, opportunities, pipelines, and sales forecasting
- **Marketing Automation:** Orchestrates campaigns, manages segmentation, nurtures leads, tracks performance
- **Service Automation:** Handles customer inquiries, support tickets, case management, and service workflow

**Use Case:** B2B technology vendor uses operational CRM to qualify leads, schedule demos, and move deals through pipeline efficiently.

### Analytical CRM
Centered on analysis and interpretation of customer data to drive business decisions:
- **Data Mining:** Identifies patterns in customer behavior and purchasing trends
- **Segmentation:** Groups customers by demographics, behavior, or value for targeted marketing
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecasts sales, customer churn, and customer lifetime value (CLV)

**Use Case:** Telecom provider analyzes call logs and support data to predict which customers are likely to churn and launches retention campaigns.

### Collaborative (Strategic) CRM
Ensures seamless communication and information sharing among internal teams and external partners:
- **Interaction Management:** Tracks every customer touchpoint regardless of channel
- **Channel Management:** Coordinates messages and service delivery across sales, support, and marketing
- **Partner Relationship Management:** Integrates with distributors, resellers, and service providers

**Use Case:** Global manufacturer shares customer feedback between sales, engineering, and product development, accelerating product improvements.
