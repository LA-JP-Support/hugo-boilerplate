## What is Gumloop?

Gumloop is a modern, no-code platform for building intelligent automation workflows ("Flows") powered by AI. Unlike traditional automation tools relying solely on rigid, rule-based triggers and actions, Gumloop is AI-native—designed from scratch to deeply integrate large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT series and Anthropic's Claude into every layer of its automation engine.

**Core Functionality:**

- **Automated Workflows** – Build sequences of tasks spanning multiple apps and data sources
- **AI Agents** – Deploy agents that interpret plain language instructions, decide which workflows to run, and adapt based on live context
- **Drag-and-Drop Builder** – Design automations visually by connecting modular "nodes" on a canvas
- **Advanced Data Handling** – Pull, process, and act on information across emails, spreadsheets, CRMs, web pages

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – Open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data with natural-language scripting
- **Browser Automation** – Chrome extension for direct, AI-powered web scraping and browser tasks
- **Custom Integrations** – Use plain English to describe new automations; AI builds the backend logic

## How Gumloop Works

### Workflows (Flows)

**Visual Automations:**  
Step-by-step sequences designed in a graphical builder where each step is a "node"—an action like reading a database, scraping a page, running AI analysis, or sending an email.

**Triggers:**  
Flows start from various events (webhooks, schedules, new data) or manually.

**Advanced Concepts:**

- **Subflows** – Reusable, modular mini-workflows invoked from multiple parent Flows
- **Conditional Logic** – If/then branches, batch processing, and error handling
- **MCP Nodes** – Custom nodes built via natural language prompts leveraging Model Context Protocol

### Agents

AI-powered orchestrators that:

- Interpret complex instructions ("Summarize all unread Gmail threads about project X")
- Decide autonomously which Flows/Subflows to run and in what order
- Handle context-aware tasks requiring reasoning, judgment, or multi-step problem solving
- Embed in Slack, Chrome, or trigger by API/webhooks

## Key Features

**Visual Automation Builder:**

- Drag-and-drop UI for connecting nodes, visualizing logic, and debugging
- 100+ pre-built nodes for integrations, data processing, AI tasks, loops, and branching
- Subflows for composing complex automations by nesting reusable logic

**AI-Powered Automation:**

- AI nodes for summarization, data extraction, categorization, content generation, and semantic analysis
- Prompt-to-create functionality building new nodes and Flows from natural language
- MCP scripting generating reusable, editable scripts for deterministic, repeatable automation

**App and Data Integrations:**

- 50+ native integrations: Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, Salesforce, Notion, Airtable, Apollo, Zendesk
- Website scraping via no-code browser extension for AI-powered data extraction
- Custom APIs with webhook, RESTful endpoint, and direct API call support

**Advanced Workflow Logic:**

- Conditional branches building flows that adapt to data and context
- Loop mode for batch processing large datasets or lists
- Triggers for scheduled runs, external events, and manual execution

**Templates and Sharing:**

- 60+ pre-built automations for marketing, sales, support, and operations
- Shareable workflows publishable as mini-apps for teammates or clients

**Security and Collaboration:**

- Team workspaces for secure flow and credential sharing
- SOC2/GDPR compliance with enterprise-grade security
- Role-based access controlling permissions across team members

## Comparing Gumloop

**AI-Native:**  
Built from day one to harness LLMs for context-aware automations, not just rule-based triggers.

**MCP-Enabled:**  
Uses Model Context Protocol for seamless, natural-language integration with external tools and APIs.

**Visual and Conversational:**  
Drag-and-drop builder plus prompt-based creation via Gummie assistant.

**Reusable Components:**  
Subflows, templates, and MCP scripts to maximize efficiency and reduce redundancy.

**Flexible Integrations:**  
Connects new and legacy SaaS, custom APIs, and browser-based data sources.

**Deterministic Scripting:**  
MCP scripting enables repeatable, scalable, and editable workflows crucial for enterprise reliability.

## Getting Started

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Sign Up** – Access Gumloop Hub with free trial (no credit card required)
2. **Choose Template or Start Fresh** – Customize pre-built templates or build your own Flow
3. **Use Visual Builder** – Drag nodes onto canvas; each node represents a task or integration
4. **Add Triggers** – New email, scheduled time, webhook, manual run
5. **Integrate Tools** – Connect Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Salesforce, Notion
6. **Leverage AI Nodes** – Add summarization, data extraction, categorization, or content generation
