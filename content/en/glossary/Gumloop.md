## What is Gumloop?

Gumloop is a modern, no-code platform for building intelligent automation workflows ("Flows") powered by AI. Unlike traditional automation tools relying solely on rigid, rule-based triggers and actions, Gumloop is AI-native—designed from scratch to deeply integrate large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT series and Anthropic's Claude into every layer of its automation engine.

<strong>Core Functionality:</strong>- <strong>Automated Workflows</strong>– Build sequences of tasks spanning multiple apps and data sources
- <strong>AI Agents</strong>– Deploy agents that interpret plain language instructions, decide which workflows to run, and adapt based on live context
- <strong>Drag-and-Drop Builder</strong>– Design automations visually by connecting modular "nodes" on a canvas
- <strong>Advanced Data Handling</strong>– Pull, process, and act on information across emails, spreadsheets, CRMs, web pages

<strong>Key Differentiators:</strong>- <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>– Open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data with natural-language scripting
- <strong>Browser Automation</strong>– Chrome extension for direct, AI-powered web scraping and browser tasks
- <strong>Custom Integrations</strong>– Use plain English to describe new automations; AI builds the backend logic

## How Gumloop Works

### Workflows (Flows)

<strong>Visual Automations:</strong>Step-by-step sequences designed in a graphical builder where each step is a "node"—an action like reading a database, scraping a page, running AI analysis, or sending an email.

<strong>Triggers:</strong>Flows start from various events (webhooks, schedules, new data) or manually.

<strong>Advanced Concepts:</strong>- <strong>Subflows</strong>– Reusable, modular mini-workflows invoked from multiple parent Flows
- <strong>Conditional Logic</strong>– If/then branches, batch processing, and error handling
- <strong>MCP Nodes</strong>– Custom nodes built via natural language prompts leveraging Model Context Protocol

### Agents

AI-powered orchestrators that:

- Interpret complex instructions ("Summarize all unread Gmail threads about project X")
- Decide autonomously which Flows/Subflows to run and in what order
- Handle context-aware tasks requiring reasoning, judgment, or multi-step problem solving
- Embed in Slack, Chrome, or trigger by API/webhooks

## Key Features

<strong>Visual Automation Builder:</strong>- Drag-and-drop UI for connecting nodes, visualizing logic, and debugging
- 100+ pre-built nodes for integrations, data processing, AI tasks, loops, and branching
- Subflows for composing complex automations by nesting reusable logic

<strong>AI-Powered Automation:</strong>- AI nodes for summarization, data extraction, categorization, content generation, and semantic analysis
- Prompt-to-create functionality building new nodes and Flows from natural language
- MCP scripting generating reusable, editable scripts for deterministic, repeatable automation

<strong>App and Data Integrations:</strong>- 50+ native integrations: Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, Salesforce, Notion, Airtable, Apollo, Zendesk
- Website scraping via no-code browser extension for AI-powered data extraction
- Custom APIs with webhook, RESTful endpoint, and direct API call support

<strong>Advanced Workflow Logic:</strong>- Conditional branches building flows that adapt to data and context
- Loop mode for batch processing large datasets or lists
- Triggers for scheduled runs, external events, and manual execution

<strong>Templates and Sharing:</strong>- 60+ pre-built automations for marketing, sales, support, and operations
- Shareable workflows publishable as mini-apps for teammates or clients

<strong>Security and Collaboration:</strong>- Team workspaces for secure flow and credential sharing
- SOC2/GDPR compliance with enterprise-grade security
- Role-based access controlling permissions across team members

## Comparing Gumloop

<strong>AI-Native:</strong>Built from day one to harness LLMs for context-aware automations, not just rule-based triggers.

<strong>MCP-Enabled:</strong>Uses Model Context Protocol for seamless, natural-language integration with external tools and APIs.

<strong>Visual and Conversational:</strong>Drag-and-drop builder plus prompt-based creation via Gummie assistant.

<strong>Reusable Components:</strong>Subflows, templates, and MCP scripts to maximize efficiency and reduce redundancy.

<strong>Flexible Integrations:</strong>Connects new and legacy SaaS, custom APIs, and browser-based data sources.

<strong>Deterministic Scripting:</strong>MCP scripting enables repeatable, scalable, and editable workflows crucial for enterprise reliability.

## Use Cases by Role

<strong>Support Automation:</strong>- Ticket Prioritization: Pull Zendesk tickets, categorize urgency, summarize issues, notify via Slack
- Customer Feedback Reports: Aggregate feedback, generate actionable summaries

<strong>Operations:</strong>- Document Processing: Extract data from PDFs, auto-fill forms, summarize contracts
- Batch Data Sync: Move data between Google Sheets and CRMs, clean and reformat lists

## Getting Started

<strong>Step-by-Step:</strong>1. <strong>Sign Up</strong>– Access Gumloop Hub with free trial (no credit card required)
2. <strong>Choose Template or Start Fresh</strong>– Customize pre-built templates or build your own Flow
3. <strong>Use Visual Builder</strong>– Drag nodes onto canvas; each node represents a task or integration
4. <strong>Add Triggers</strong>– New email, scheduled time, webhook, manual run
5. <strong>Integrate Tools</strong>– Connect Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Salesforce, Notion
6. <strong>Leverage AI Nodes</strong>– Add summarization, data extraction, categorization, or content generation
7. <strong>Test and Refine</strong>– Use sandbox mode, review logs, troubleshoot errors
8. <strong>Deploy and Share</strong>– Publish flows for team or turn into public mini-apps
