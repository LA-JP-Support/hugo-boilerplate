## What Is a Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base (KB) is a digital repository that compiles and organizes information for easy retrieval and reuse. It serves as the "single source of truth" for an organization, supporting self-service, consistent communication, and operational efficiency. Unlike traditional databases that store raw transactional data, a knowledge base structures content to mirror human understanding—connecting context, processes, and actionable insights.

<strong>Fundamental Purpose:</strong>Enable users (customers, employees, or automated systems) to find accurate answers quickly without requiring direct human assistance.

### Core Characteristics

## Frequently Asked Questions

<strong>Q: How many articles should a knowledge base have?</strong>A: There's no fixed number—focus on covering the most common 80% of questions (Pareto principle). Start with 50-100 core articles, then expand based on analytics showing gaps.

<strong>Q: How often should articles be updated?</strong>A: Review high-traffic articles quarterly, medium-traffic articles semi-annually, and low-traffic annually. Update immediately when processes or products change.

<strong>Q: Should we have separate KBs for internal and external users?</strong>A: It depends on your needs. Hybrid KBs with role-based access are efficient but require robust permission systems. Separate KBs provide clearer boundaries but duplicate some content.

<strong>Q: How do we measure ROI?</strong>A: Track ticket deflection rate, cost per contact reduction, time saved by agents, and customer satisfaction improvements. Typical ROI appears within 6-12 months.

<strong>Q: What if users don't adopt the knowledge base?</strong>A: Promote it prominently, train users, integrate into workflows, improve search quality, and gather feedback to understand barriers.

<strong>Q: How technical should content be?</strong>A: Match your audience's knowledge level. External content should assume minimal technical knowledge; internal technical docs can be more detailed.
