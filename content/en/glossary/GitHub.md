## How GitHub Works

GitHub operates as a cloud-based Git repository hosting service that provides a web interface layer on top of Git's command-line functionality. When developers create a repository on GitHub, they establish a remote location where their Git repository can be stored, accessed, and shared with collaborators. The platform maintains the complete history of all changes made to the repository, including who made changes, when they were made, and what specific modifications occurred.

The typical GitHub workflow begins when a developer clones a repository to their local machine, creating a local copy of the entire project history. As they make changes to the code, they commit those changes to their local Git repository with descriptive messages explaining what was modified. When ready to share their work, developers push their commits to the GitHub repository, making their changes available to other team members and updating the central repository.

Collaboration on GitHub primarily occurs through the branching and merging workflow, where developers create separate branches for new features or bug fixes, work on those branches independently, and then merge their changes back into the main codebase through pull requests. This process ensures that multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work, while maintaining a clean and organized project history.

GitHub's web interface provides visual representations of repository activity, including commit histories, file differences, and branch visualizations that make it easy to understand project evolution over time. The platform also integrates with various development tools and services through APIs and webhooks, enabling automated workflows that respond to repository events such as new commits, pull requests, or issue creation.
