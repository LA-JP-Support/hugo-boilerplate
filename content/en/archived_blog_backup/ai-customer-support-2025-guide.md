## What is AI Customer Support?

AI customer support is a system that uses artificial intelligence to automatically respond to customer inquiries. Unlike human agents, AI can provide support 24/7, 365 days a year. Key features include instant responses and multilingual capabilities.

This system utilizes several technologies. Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps AI understand and respond to human language. Machine Learning is a mechanism that allows AI to expand and improve its knowledge. By integrating with databases, AI can reference vast amounts of information. Voice and image recognition capabilities enable handling of non-text inputs.

AI customer support includes various forms such as automated FAQ responses, AI chatbots, and virtual assistants. For example, tools used in SmartWeb's construction services such as LiveAgent and FlowHunt are AI chatbots that use company manuals and FAQs as knowledge bases to provide quick and accurate answers to user questions.

## Evolution of Technology and Its History

The origins of AI customer support trace back to the 1960s chatbot "ELIZA." Subsequently, in the 1990s, rule-based automated response systems became widespread. In the 2010s, advancements in machine learning and Deep Learning enabled AI to handle more natural conversations and complex questions.

From 2016, Cloud AI and Generative AI became available, evolving AI customer support as follows:

### Proliferation of Multimodal AI

Multimodal AI that can analyze various types of information including text, voice, images, and videos is emerging. This allows users to make inquiries not only through words but also using images and voice. For example, in 2025, major airlines and e-commerce companies have adopted this technology.

### Real-time Response and Emotion Analysis

AI can not only respond quickly to numerous inquiries but also understand customer emotions and conversation flow to provide more personalized responses. This enhances customer satisfaction and business efficiency.

### Knowledge Auto-Evolution through Generative AI

AI can automatically update FAQ and manual content, constantly maintaining optimal responses. This service mechanism is being used by various companies.

## Global Adoption and Standardization

AI customer support is spreading among companies worldwide, including in Europe, America, and Asia. As of 2025, not only large enterprises but also SMEs and startups are adopting AI support. AI-powered support is used to enhance Customer Experience (CX) and strengthen corporate competitiveness.

Scientific research shows that AI performance doubles every six months. Customers are also increasingly expecting AI-powered support.

## 2025 Global Trends in AI Customer Support

### Global Market Size and Growth Rate

In 2025, the AI customer support market is rapidly expanding worldwide. The AI chatbot market size is predicted to reach $10-15 billion.

## AI Technology Advancement and Impact on Japanese Companies

### Current State of Technological Innovation in AI Customer Support

In Japanese AI customer support, new technologies such as generative AI and multimodal AI are being widely adopted toward 2025. Latest AI chatbots use company manuals, FAQs, and website information to converse in natural language and immediately answer user questions. Some services achieve accuracy rates exceeding 98%. Technologies that can analyze images, voice, and text together as multimodal AI, as well as emotion detection and intent prediction, are also spreading.

### Unique Challenges Facing Japanese Companies

When using AI customer support in Japan, language characteristics, the culture called "omotenashi" (hospitality), and detailed operational rules have an impact. For example, direct translation-like responses don't easily increase customer satisfaction, and contextual understanding and honorific language support unique to Japanese, as well as emotional responses, are challenges in improving automated response accuracy.

However, many cases report reduced inquiry response times through AI use, 24/7 support, and multilingual communication capabilities.

### Latest Japanese AI Customer Support Cases

Tools like "LiveAgent" and "FlowHunt" used in SmartWeb's construction services create mechanisms where AI automatically reads specialized manuals and instruction manuals to immediately answer questions. These AIs enable users to access information through new methods of "dialogue" rather than "reading and searching," helping improve both corporate customer support quality and cost reduction.

### Strategic Hints for Global Expansion

<strong>Necessity of Multilingual Support:</strong>For international expansion, communicating with customers in local languages is essential. However, traditional systems required building separate systems for each language, incurring costs and time.

<strong>Leveraging Japanese Strengths:</strong>Japanese companies' "omotenashi" spirit and meticulous attention to detail are highly valued worldwide. Combining this with AI can provide unique services unavailable in other countries.

<strong>SmartWeb AI Chatbot Advantages:</strong>- <strong>Multilingual Support:</strong>Single system capable of handling multiple languages
