Thank you for using BuildVu, JPedal, and JDeli.

We are pleased to announce the complete renewal of the IDR Solutions product support portals.

### Key Improvements

**Enhanced Japanese Documentation**
We now provide Japanese documentation equivalent to the support documents published by IDR Solutions.

**Regular Updates**
Release notes for all product version updates released every 6 weeks will now be delivered in Japanese in a timely manner.

**Future Developments**
We will gradually implement features to enhance user experience, including advanced instant support through our already deployed AI chatbot and an advanced search system.
