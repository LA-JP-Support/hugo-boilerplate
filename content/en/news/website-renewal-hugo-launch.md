Interwork Co., Ltd. has completely renewed the SmartWeb official website using Hugo, the world's fastest static site generator.

## Background

Our previous WordPress site faced challenges with dynamic page generation performance and a complex multi-plan service structure that was difficult for customers to navigate. This renewal addresses these issues to provide a faster, clearer web experience for our customers.

## Key Changes

### 1. Lightning-Fast Performance with Hugo

We adopted Hugo, the world's fastest static site generator built with Go. The database-free static site architecture delivers:

- **Dramatically faster page loads**: Pages generate in milliseconds with ultra-fast CDN delivery
- **Zero security vulnerabilities**: No database means no SQL injection or similar attack vectors
- **Lower operational costs**: Serverless architecture significantly reduces infrastructure expenses

### 2. Simplified Service Structure

We reorganized from four separate plans (Basic, Call Center, SNS/EC Enhancement, AI Chatbot) into **two clear solutions**.

| Previous Site | New Site |
|---------------|----------|
| 4 plan types | **AI Customer Support** + **AI Content Creation & Web Build** |
| Scattered features | 4/2 features consolidated per solution |
| Hard to choose | Easy to select based on your needs |

### 3. Bilingual Japanese/English Support

The previous site was Japanese-only. The new site offers **complete Japanese and English bilingual support**, making SmartWeb information accessible to international customers and businesses considering global expansion.

### 4. New 1,000+ Term Glossary

We created a comprehensive **glossary with over 1,000 professional terms** covering AI chatbots, customer support, and content marketing—available in both Japanese and English. Search by Japanese syllabary or alphabetically to quickly find and understand industry terminology.

### 5. Complete Support Documentation Overhaul

The support portal has also been rebuilt with Hugo and is now live at [support.smartweb.jp](https://support.smartweb.jp/en/docs/).

**New Support Portal Features:**
- Feature guides for AI Chatbot, AI Email Response, AI Answer Assistant, and Ticket System
- Detailed documentation on Settings, Security, and Pricing
- Fast search functionality
- Bilingual Japanese/English support

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Site Generator | Hugo |
| Hosting | AWS Amplify |
| CDN | CloudFront |
| Version Control | GitHub |
| Deployment | Automated via GitHub integration |

## Looking Ahead

Building on this renewal, we plan to:

- Continuously expand the glossary
- Further enrich blog content
- Add customer case studies
- Consider expanding language support
