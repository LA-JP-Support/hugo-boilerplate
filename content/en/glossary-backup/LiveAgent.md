## What is LiveAgent?

LiveAgent is an advanced customer service and help desk software platform designed to centralize and manage all customer interactions across a spectrum of communication channels. It combines email, live chat, phone calls, social media, and self-service tools within a single, intuitive interface. This unified approach enables organizations to streamline their support operations and deliver cohesive, high-quality service regardless of the communication channel.

LiveAgent functions as both an omnichannel help desk and an AI-enabled automation suite. The platform empowers support teams to respond to tickets, engage with customers in real time, automate repetitive tasks, and preserve a complete history of all interactions for future reference. It is available as a cloud-based SaaS solution or as an on-premises deployment, offering flexibility to businesses with varying infrastructure needs.
