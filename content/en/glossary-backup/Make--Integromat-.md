## What is Make (Integromat)?

Make, formerly Integromat, is a no-code platform enabling users—ranging from small businesses to large enterprises—to automate workflows and tasks between apps, APIs, and data sources. It provides a powerful visual scenario builder, real-time automation, data transformation, and advanced error handling, making it one of the most flexible and deeply customizable automation tools available.

Make connects over 2,500+ apps, including productivity tools (Google Workspace, Slack, Notion), e-commerce (Shopify, WooCommerce), marketing automation (Mailchimp, HubSpot), databases (Airtable, MySQL), and virtually any REST API. Its drag-and-drop interface allows the design of linear or highly branched workflows, supporting data mapping, transformation, scheduling, and advanced conditional logic.

The platform is suited for anyone aiming to eliminate repetitive manual work, orchestrate business processes, or integrate disparate systems, all without traditional programming.
## How Does Make Work?

Make operates by creating "scenarios," which are visual representations of workflows. Each scenario is constructed from modules, including triggers, actions, and tools (such as filters, routers, iterators, and aggregators), all connected via a flowchart-like interface.

<strong>Scenario Workflow:</strong>1. <strong>Trigger:</strong>An event in a connected app initiates the scenario, such as a new email, form submission, database entry, or webhook call.
2. <strong>Modules:</strong>These perform actions (send an email, update a spreadsheet, create a task, call an API) or transform data (parse JSON, filter, or aggregate).
3. <strong>Logic & Filters:</strong>Employ conditional logic (If/Else, Switch, Routers) to branch, filter, and direct data flow.
4. <strong>Error Handling:</strong>Define fallback actions using in-module or global error handlers, specifying retries, skips, or notifications.
5. <strong>Scheduling:</strong>Scenarios can run on a schedule (every X minutes/hours/days), be triggered by real-time webhooks, or initiated manually.

<strong>Visual Scenario Builder:</strong>The builder enables users to visually map out workflows, see data as it passes through each module, and debug with step-level logs.

<strong>Advanced Capabilities:</strong>- <strong>Custom Functions:</strong>Build reusable logic blocks (e.g., data transformations or calculations) for complex scenarios. [See Make’s Custom Functions](https://www.make.com/en/blog/custom-functions-in-make-best-practices)
- <strong>API Integrations:</strong>Use HTTP modules for advanced API calls, including custom authentication, pagination, and header management.
- <strong>Data Stores:</strong>Persist data across scenarios and runs, enabling stateful automations and multi-step processes.
## Key Features

<strong>1. Visual Workflow Builder:</strong>Make’s drag-and-drop interface lets users design, edit, and visualize workflows, supporting both simple and highly complex logic.

<strong>2. 2,500+ Integrations:</strong>Native modules for Google Workspace, Slack, Shopify, Notion, HubSpot, databases, AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic), and custom API access via HTTP.

<strong>3. Advanced Logic:</strong>Incorporate filters, routers (branching), iterators (process lists/arrays), aggregators (combine multiple data bundles), and conditional logic.

<strong>4. Real-Time & Scheduled Automation:</strong>Trigger workflows instantly using webhooks, or schedule by minute, hour, or day.

<strong>5. Data Mapping and Transformation:</strong>Map data between modules, reformat values, parse JSON/XML, manipulate text (via functions and regex), and handle dates.

<strong>6. Error Handling & Logging:</strong>Configure error handlers per module or scenario, with options for retries, skips, or custom notifications. Access detailed execution logs for every scenario run.

<strong>7. Data Stores and Variables:</strong>Persist data across runs, manage state, and enable complex, multi-stage automations.

<strong>3. Set a Trigger:</strong>- Select a trigger app/event (e.g., "Watch for new Google Form responses") and authenticate.

<strong>4. Add Actions and Modules:</strong>- Add modules for each step: send an email, update a sheet, call an API.

<strong>5. Map Data Fields:</strong>- Connect outputs to inputs across modules using Make’s data-mapping panel.

<strong>6. Add Logic (Filters, Routers, Iterators):</strong>- Filters gatekeep data; routers branch flows based on conditions; iterators process lists/arrays.

- [Error Handling Docs](https://help.make.com/error-handling)

<strong>8. Test the Scenario:</strong>- Click “Run once” to debug with sample data. Review logs for errors.

<strong>9. Schedule or Activate:</strong>- Set up scheduling or webhooks for real-time triggers. Enable the scenario.

<strong>10. Monitor and Refine:</strong>- Check execution logs, refine mappings, and optimize for performance.
## Best Practices, Tips, and Pitfalls

<strong>Best Practices:</strong>- <strong>Start Simple:</strong>Build and test small automations before scaling up.
- <strong>Use Templates:</strong>Start with a template, then adapt to your needs.
- <strong>Name Everything:</strong>Modules, variables, and routers should have clear, descriptive names.
- <strong>Leverage Filters Early:</strong>Prevent unwanted data from propagating through your scenario.
- <strong>Monitor Logs:</strong>Regularly review execution logs for failures or bottlenecks.
- <strong>Document Logic:</strong>Keep notes on scenario flows, especially for complex business processes.
- <strong>Secure Webhooks:</strong>Use secret tokens, IP whitelisting, and HTTPS for webhook security.
- <strong>Test with Real Data:</strong>Use test accounts and sample data to avoid impacting production.
- <strong>Handle Errors Proactively:</strong>Configure error handlers and set up notifications for failures.
- <strong>Optimize for Efficiency:</strong>Break large workflows into manageable scenarios; use data stores for persistent state.

<strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong>- <strong>Overcomplicating Scenarios:</strong>Split large automations into sub-scenarios for better performance and troubleshooting.
- <strong>Skipping Error Handling:</strong>Always add error handlers to avoid unexpected data loss or process halts.
- <strong>Not Monitoring Usage:</strong>Monitor operations/credit usage to avoid hitting plan limits.
- <strong>Forgetting Security:</strong>Expose webhooks only as needed and secure sensitive data.
