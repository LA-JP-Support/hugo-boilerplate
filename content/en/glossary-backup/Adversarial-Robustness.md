## 1. Definition

**Adversarial Robustness** is the property of a machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) model to maintain reliable performance when faced with adversarial input—intentionally crafted data designed to induce errors or misclassifications. A robust model resists being fooled by these adversarial manipulations, even when such perturbations are nearly imperceptible to human observers.

> **Adversarial Robustness:** The capacity of a machine learning model to withstand the impact of adversarial examples—inputs crafted to cause misclassification or malfunction—without significant performance degradation under specified perturbation constraints.

Adversarial robustness is a foundational requirement for trustworthy, safe, and secure AI systems, especially in contexts where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences.

## 2. Context and Significance

### 2.1. Why Adversarial Robustness Matters

AI systems are now integral to domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare diagnostics, banking, and [content moderation](/en/glossary/content-moderation/). In these areas, targeted adversarial manipulations that may be invisible to humans can force models into catastrophic errors:

- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Small stickers on stop signs can cause vision systems to misclassify them as speed limits, threatening lives ([DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/en/all-about-autonomous-vehicles)).
- **Fraud Detection:** Slightly altered transaction records can slip past fraud detectors, causing financial losses.
- **Medical Imaging:** Adversarial noise on radiological images can mask or create false pathologies for diagnostic AI.

### 2.2. Relationship to AI Safety and Ethics

Adversarial robustness is vital for ethical AI deployment. Trustworthy AI requires fairness, privacy, [transparency](/en/glossary/transparency/), accountability, and robust resistance to adversarial subversion. Weakness in adversarial robustness can lead to safety hazards, unfair treatment, or privacy breaches.

## 3. Types of Adversarial Attacks

Adversarial attacks differ by attacker knowledge, objectives, and the ML pipeline stage targeted.

### 3.1. White-Box Attacks

Attackers have full access to the model’s architecture, parameters, and training data.

- **Mechanism:** Use model gradients to optimize input perturbations that cause misclassification.
- **Techniques:** Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).
- **Mathematical Formulation:**  
  For model $f(x)$ and input $x$, find adversarial example $\hat{x}$:
  $$
  \hat{x} = \arg\max_{\|\delta\|\leq \epsilon} \mathcal{L}(f(x+\delta), y)
  $$
  where $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss, $y$ is the label, $\|\delta\|$ is the norm constraint.

  - [FGSM explained (Goodfellow et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)

### 3.2. Black-Box Attacks

Attackers only access model inputs and outputs (e.g., API endpoint).

- **Mechanism:** Infer model behavior through queries or transfer adversarial examples from surrogate models.
- **Techniques:** Zeroth-order optimization, transfer attacks, query-based attacks.

### 3.3. Poisoning Attacks

Target the model’s training phase by injecting malicious or mislabeled data.

- **Impact:** Corrupts learned model, embedding vulnerabilities or bias.
- **Variants:** Clean-label poisoning (malicious data with correct labels), label flipping.
- [IBM Research: Poisoned data and UDA](https://research.ibm.com/publications/understanding-the-limits-of-unsupervised-domain-adaptation-via-data-poisoning)

### 3.4. Evasion Attacks

At inference/deployment, adversarially perturbed inputs are used to induce errors.

- **Targeted:** Forces a specific incorrect prediction.
- **Untargeted:** Causes any incorrect prediction.

### 3.5. Physical Attacks

Exploit the physical environment; adversarial examples remain effective in the real world.

- **Example:** Adversarial glasses fooling facial recognition systems.

## 4. Mechanics of Adversarial Examples

### 4.1. How Adversarial Examples Are Generated

Adversarial examples are generated by optimizing small perturbations to the input, maximizing model error while keeping changes imperceptible.

- **Optimization-based methods:**  
  $$
  \text{Find}~\delta~\text{such that}~f(x+\delta) \neq f(x),~\|\delta\|_p \leq \epsilon
  $$
  Where $\|\cdot\|_p$ is an $L_p$ norm.

#### 4.1.1. Perturbation Norms

- **$L_0$ norm:** Number of features changed.
- **$L_2$ norm:** Euclidean norm (overall energy).
- **$L_\infty$ norm:** Maximum change to any feature.

#### 4.1.2. Example Code (PyTorch)

```python
# Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
import torch

epsilon = 0.03
x.requires_grad = True
output = model(x)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
perturbed_x = x + epsilon * x.grad.sign()
```

#### 4.1.3. Decision Boundary Exploitation

Adversarial examples exploit the model’s decision boundaries—pushing inputs across these boundaries with minimal changes, leading to misclassification.

## 5. Real-World Examples and Use Cases

### 5.1. Computer Vision

- **Stop Sign Misclassification:** Minor modifications cause vision models in autonomous vehicles to misclassify traffic signs, potentially leading to dangerous actions ([DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/en/all-about-autonomous-vehicles)).

### 5.2. Security and Fraud

- **Banking:** Adversarial transaction records can bypass fraud detection.
- **Malware Detection:** Byte-level perturbations can fool static malware classifiers.

### 5.3. Healthcare

- **Medical Imaging:** Adversarial noise in MRI/X-ray images can cause AI to miss or misdiagnose diseases.

### 5.4. Natural Language Processing

- **Toxicity Detection:** Slight rewording can evade content moderation.
- **Language Models:** Adversarial prompts can induce unsafe or harmful outputs.

## 6. Defense Strategies

Defending against adversarial attacks is an ongoing challenge. Key strategies include:

### 6.1. Adversarial Training

- **Definition:** Incorporate adversarial examples during model training.
- **Strengths:** Increases robustness against known attack types.
- **Limitations:** Computationally expensive and may not generalize to new attacks.

  - [Madry et al. "Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)

### 6.2. Input Preprocessing and Validation

- **Techniques:** Apply transformations (e.g., noise reduction, normalization) to sanitize or detect adversarial inputs.
- **Strengths:** Low overhead for some attacks.
- **Limitations:** Adaptive attackers can bypass simple defenses.

### 6.3. Ensemble Methods

- **Use:** Aggregate predictions from multiple models.
- **Strengths:** Reduces single-point vulnerabilities.
- **Limitations:** Increases computation and complexity.

### 6.4. Monitoring and Anomaly Detection

- **Methods:** Monitor confidence scores, output distributions, or input statistics to detect anomalies.

### 6.5. Secure Development Lifecycle

- **Practices:** Integrate security and robustness checks at every stage; includes threat modeling, [red teaming](/en/glossary/red-teaming/), audits, and patching.

## 7. Evaluation and Measurement

Robustness assessment requires systematic testing and benchmarking.

### 7.1. Common Approaches

- **Benchmarking:** Standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) under FGSM/PGD attacks.
- **Red Teaming:** Simulated adversarial attacks by internal or external teams.
- **Metrics:**

## 15. FAQ

**Q: Is adversarial robustness the same as general robustness?**  
*A: No. General robustness is stability under any input variation (e.g., noise, distribution shift), while adversarial robustness targets resistance to intentional, malicious manipulation.*

**Q: Can adversarial attacks be fully prevented?**  
*A: No defense is perfect. The aim is to minimize risk and make attacks as difficult and costly as possible.*

**Q: What is the main difference between poisoning and evasion attacks?**  
*A: Poisoning attacks corrupt training data; evasion attacks manipulate inference-time input.*
