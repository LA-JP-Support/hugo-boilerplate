## What is CRM?

CRM, or Customer Relationship Management, is both a business strategy and a technology platform. It empowers organizations to record, track, and manage every interaction with current and prospective customers. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, optimize retention, and streamline the processes that support these objectives. CRM systems unify data across sales, marketing, customer service, and other departments, creating a single, 360-degree view of each customer. This enables organizations to deliver personalized and timely communications, anticipate needs, and resolve issues efficiently.  
- CRM platforms are used by companies of all sizes and industries, including B2B, B2C, government, and non-profits.  
- CRM systems are essential for businesses that want to centralize data, avoid silos, and maximize the value of every customer relationship.  
- According to Salesforce, the average company uses nearly 900 different applications, and only 29% are integrated—CRM aims to connect these silos ([Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/what-is-crm/)).

## How Does CRM Work?

CRM systems aggregate and organize customer data from multiple sources and channels, including:  
- Email, phone, chat, and SMS  
- Web forms and website visits  
- Social media interactions  
- Purchase and transaction history  
- Customer support tickets  
- Marketing campaign engagement

This data is stored in a centralized platform, accessible to authorized users across the organization.  
**Core CRM Processes:**1. **Data Collection:**Every customer touchpoint—sales calls, emails, support interactions, social media—is logged and associated with the customer’s record.  
2. **Data Integration:**Information from disparate business systems (ERP, marketing automation, e-commerce, accounting) is unified into a comprehensive customer profile.  
3. **Automation:**Repetitive tasks such as lead assignment, follow-ups, appointment scheduling, and ticket routing are automated to increase efficiency and ensure timely response.  
4. **Analytics and Reporting:**CRM platforms analyze customer data to uncover trends, segment audiences, forecast sales, and measure performance of campaigns and teams.  
5. **Collaboration:**CRM fosters cross-functional collaboration, allowing sales, marketing, service, and support teams to share insights, coordinate actions, and deliver a seamless customer experience.

**Example Scenario:**A retail chain uses its CRM to monitor purchase histories, service requests, and marketing responses. When a high-value customer submits a support inquiry, the system alerts the relevant agent and provides a complete profile, including past purchases and communications, enabling prompt and tailored service.
