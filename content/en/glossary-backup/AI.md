## Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems and machines capable of simulating human intelligence. These systems perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, understanding language, and decision-making. Unlike traditional software, which follows explicit instructions, AI leverages algorithms and large datasets to autonomously adapt, improve, and act independently in complex environments.

- [Tableau: What is AI?](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/what-is)

Key characteristics of AI include the ability to:
- Perceive and interpret sensory data (images, sound, text)
- Learn from new data and experiences
- Generalize patterns and apply them to novel situations
- Make recommendations or decisions without explicit programming

Generative AI, a recent advancement, can create original content in the form of text, images, video, or audio by learning from massive datasets.

## How AI Works: Data, Algorithms, and Learning

AI development and operation involve several key stages:

**1. Data Collection and Preparation:**  
AI requires large and relevant datasets (images, text, signals) for training. Data must be cleaned, labeled, and organized.

**2. Algorithms:**  
Mathematical models process input data to find patterns, make predictions, and solve problems. Modern AI uses statistical, probabilistic, and neural network-based algorithms.

**3. Model Training (Learning):**  
- **Supervised Learning:** Model learns from labeled input-output pairs.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Model detects patterns without labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Model learns via trial-and-error, optimizing for maximum reward.

**4. Model Evaluation and Deployment:**  
Trained models are tested on new data, fine-tuned, and deployed into production systems for real-world inference.

**5. Main Approaches:**  
- **Rule-based Systems:** Early AI, using explicit if-then rules.
- **Statistical Learning:** Modern AI, using probabilistic models for prediction and generalization.
