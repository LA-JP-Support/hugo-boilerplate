## Definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems and machines capable of simulating human intelligence. These systems perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, understanding language, and decision-making. Unlike traditional software, which follows explicit instructions, AI leverages algorithms and large datasets to autonomously adapt, improve, and act independently in complex environments.

- [Tableau: What is AI?](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/ai/what-is)

Key characteristics of AI include the ability to:
- Perceive and interpret sensory data (images, sound, text)
- Learn from new data and experiences
- Generalize patterns and apply them to novel situations
- Make recommendations or decisions without explicit programming

Generative AI, a recent advancement, can create original content in the form of text, images, video, or audio by learning from massive datasets.

## How AI Works: Data, Algorithms, and Learning

AI development and operation involve several key stages:

<strong>1. Data Collection and Preparation:</strong>AI requires large and relevant datasets (images, text, signals) for training. Data must be cleaned, labeled, and organized.

<strong>2. Algorithms:</strong>Mathematical models process input data to find patterns, make predictions, and solve problems. Modern AI uses statistical, probabilistic, and neural network-based algorithms.

<strong>3. Model Training (Learning):</strong>- <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong>Model learns from labeled input-output pairs.
- <strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong>Model detects patterns without labels.
- <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong>Model learns via trial-and-error, optimizing for maximum reward.

<strong>4. Model Evaluation and Deployment:</strong>Trained models are tested on new data, fine-tuned, and deployed into production systems for real-world inference.

<strong>5. Main Approaches:</strong>- <strong>Rule-based Systems:</strong>Early AI, using explicit if-then rules.
- <strong>Statistical Learning:</strong>Modern AI, using probabilistic models for prediction and generalization.
