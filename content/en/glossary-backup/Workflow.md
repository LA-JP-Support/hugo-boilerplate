## Overview and Quick Summary

A **workflow**is a repeatable sequence of tasks or steps that directs how work moves between people, systems, or tools to achieve a business goal. Workflows provide the structure for work to be completed efficiently and consistently. They are especially valuable in digital business environments, where clarity, automation, and transparency are required for processes like onboarding, support, content approvals, and more.

Workflows eliminate ambiguity about who is responsible for what, at which stage, and with what inputs and outputs. Modern workflow approaches often leverage automation platforms, AI, and digital tools to increase speed, reduce manual effort, and improve outcomes. [Asana](https://asana.com/resources/workflow-examples), [Slack](https://slack.com/blog/productivity/what-is-a-workflow-a-guide-to-building-smarter-business-processes), and [Blue Prism](https://www.blueprism.com/guides/workflow/) highlight how workflows underpin high-performing teams and enterprise operations.

## What is a Workflow?

### Workflow Definition

A **workflow**is an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of business activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. Each step in a workflow has a specific input and output, and the movement from one step to the next is governed by predefined rules or logic.

According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/workflow), workflows are the mechanism by which people and organizations accomplish work, whether manufacturing a product, providing a service, or processing information. A workflow is distinguished by its repeatability and clarity, and is often diagrammed to ensure all participants understand their roles.

[TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/workflow) adds that workflows can be visualized via flowcharts or process maps, making it easier to identify bottlenecks and areas for automation.

**Example:**A customer support ticket workflow includes:  
- Ticket submission  
- Triage   
- Assignment to an agent  
- Resolution  
- Customer notification  
- Ticket closure  

### Key Components of a Workflow

Every workflow consists of several essential components ([Asana](https://asana.com/resources/workflow-examples), [Blue Prism](https://www.blueprism.com/guides/workflow/)):

| **Component**| **Description**|
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**| The trigger or starting point (e.g., form submission, customer request)         |
| **Tasks/Steps**| The individual actions or decisions that move work forward                      |
| **Rules**| Conditions or logic that determine workflow paths (e.g., approvals, routing)    |
| **Roles**| The people, teams, or systems responsible for each step                         |
| **Output**| The result or goal (e.g., resolved ticket, approved document, completed order)  |

Workflows are often represented as flowcharts with decision points and branches, making it easy to visualize the sequence and dependencies.

## Types of Workflows

Selecting the right workflow type depends on the structure of the work, the relationships between tasks, and the environment (manual, automated, or hybrid). Here are the most common types, with practical examples and references from [Blue Prism](https://www.blueprism.com/guides/workflow/), [Asana](https://asana.com/resources/workflow-examples), and [TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/workflow):

### Sequential Workflows

- **Description:**Tasks occur one after another in a set order. Each step depends on the completion of the previous task.
- **Example:**Employee onboarding – offer letter sent → paperwork completed → IT setup → training scheduled → orientation.
- **More info:**[Asana workflow examples](https://asana.com/resources/workflow-examples)

### Parallel Workflows

- **Description:**Multiple tasks are performed simultaneously, allowing processes to move faster.
- **Example:**During onboarding, HR prepares documents while IT sets up equipment at the same time.
- **Use case:**Increases efficiency for tasks that don’t have dependencies.

### Conditional (Rules-based) Workflows

- **Description:**The next step is determined by a condition or rule (branching logic).
- **Example:**A support ticket is routed to IT if it’s technical; otherwise, it goes to customer service.
- **More info:**[Blue Prism on workflow types](https://www.blueprism.com/guides/workflow/)

### Case Workflows

- **Description:**The path is not strictly predefined. Steps are determined as more information becomes available.
- **Example:**Legal case management, where investigation, negotiation, and resolution may happen in varying orders based on the case.
- **Advantage:**Flexibility for complex, variable scenarios.

### Project Workflows

- **Description:**Combines structure and flexibility, suited for projects with defined goals but variable steps.
- **Example:**Marketing campaign – planning → asset creation (copy, design, video) → review → launch.
- **More info:**[Asana’s project workflow templates](https://asana.com/resources/workflow-examples)

### State Machine Workflows

- **Description:**Workflow items transition between states (e.g., open, in progress, on hold, completed) rather than following a strict sequence.
- **Example:**Help desk ticket that can be reopened or put on hold based on customer input.
- **Use case:**Dynamic environments with frequent changes and reversals.

### Manual vs. Automated Workflows

- **Manual workflows**require human intervention at each step (e.g., manual approvals).
- **Automated workflows**use digital systems or bots to carry out steps based on rules (e.g., notifications, data transfers).
- **More info:**[Zendesk’s automation guide](https://www.zendesk.de/blog/workflow-automation/)

### Digital Workflows

- **Description:**Replaces paper-based processes with digital tools, supporting remote and hybrid teams.
- **Example:**Digital document approval using workflow management software and e-signatures.
- **Advantage:**Instantaneous, auditable, and easily integrated with other digital systems.

## Workflow vs. Process: Key Differences

“Workflow” and “process” are often confused but have distinct meanings ([Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/workflow/workflow-vs-process-whats-difference/), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/workflow)):

| **Aspect**| **Workflow**| **Process**|
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**| Specific sequence of tasks for one goal                         | Broader set of activities to achieve business objectives            |
| **Focus**| How tasks move between people/systems                           | What and why of business operations                                 |
| **Ownership**| Often shared across teams                                       | Usually owned by department or process owners                       |
| **Flexibility**| Can be tightly or loosely structured                            | Often encompasses multiple workflows                                |
| **Tools**| Workflow builders, project management, automation tools         | BPM (Business Process Management) software, ERP systems             |
| **Example**| Document approval, ticket resolution                            | Customer relationship management, financial reporting               |

A workflow is the “track” for tasks, while a process is the entire “train journey” with broader objectives, governance, and multiple workflows inside it. For a deeper dive, see [Kissflow’s workflow vs process comparison](https://kissflow.com/workflow/workflow-vs-process-whats-difference/).

## FAQs

### What’s the difference between a workflow and a process?
A workflow is a defined sequence of steps for completing a specific task, focusing on “how” work moves from start to finish. A process is broader, encompassing multiple workflows, governance, and strategic objectives—focusing on “what” and “why” the work is done. [Kissflow comparison](https://kissflow.com/workflow/workflow-vs-process-whats-difference/)

### How do I know which tasks to automate in a workflow?
Look for repetitive, rules-driven, high-volume tasks that are prone to errors if done manually—such as data entry, notifications, approvals, and routing. [Zendesk on workflow automation](https://www.zendesk.de/blog/workflow-automation/)

### Can workflows include both manual and automated steps?
Yes. Most effective workflows blend manual decision-making (for complex or exception cases) with automation for routine, predictable steps. [Blue Prism guide](https://www.blueprism.com/guides/workflow/)

### How do AI chatbots fit into workflow automation?
AI chatbots can act as digital workers—answering questions, collecting data, routing tickets, even resolving issues without human intervention.

### What are common signs of a broken workflow?
Frequent delays, missed steps, confusion over responsibility, redundant manual work, and lack of visibility are indicators that a workflow needs improvement or automation. [Slack guide](https://slack.com/blog/productivity/what-is-a-workflow-a-guide-to-building-smarter-business-processes)
