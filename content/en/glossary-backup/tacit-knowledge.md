## What Is Tacit Knowledge?

Tacit knowledge is the body of know-how, skills, and understandings individuals develop through direct experience, intuition, observation, and repeated practice. Unlike explicit knowledge (which is easily documented and codified), tacit knowledge is deeply internalized and often instinctive. It is sometimes called “experiential knowledge,” “tribal knowledge,” or just “know-how.” 

For example, a seasoned mechanic’s ability to “hear” engine trouble, a veteran support rep’s knack for calming irate customers, or a chef’s skill in adjusting seasoning by taste are all manifestations of tacit knowledge. As [Helpjuice](https://helpjuice.com/blog/tacit-knowledge) notes, tacit knowledge often spreads informally within organizations, is rarely written down, and may not be consciously articulated by those who possess it.

**Key characteristics:**
- Acquired through personal experience, imitation, and practice
- Difficult to express, explain, or document fully
- Often unconsciously applied in real-world contexts
- Transferred informally, often via observation, mentorship, or storytelling

## How Is Tacit Knowledge Used?

Tacit knowledge operates behind the scenes in nearly every aspect of business, technology, and daily life. It underpins how employees solve complex problems, innovate, serve customers, and adapt to shifting circumstances. In AI and automation, the challenge is to capture or simulate this “unwritten” know-how to enhance decision support, customer interactions, and workflow automation.

### Real-World Usage Scenarios
1. **Problem Solving:** Employees rely on intuition honed by experience to navigate ambiguous challenges, often without being able to explain each step.
2. **Innovation:** Teams leverage shared, implicit understanding to brainstorm breakthroughs or optimize processes.
3. **Onboarding:** New hires absorb tacit knowledge by shadowing veterans, picking up practical nuances not found in handbooks.
4. **Customer Service:** Representatives use tacit skills to interpret subtle cues in a customer’s voice or behavior and tailor responses accordingly.
5. **AI Chatbot Training:** Developers attempt to encode expert-level tacit responses into chatbots by analyzing real-world conversations and expert case handling.

## Types of Tacit Knowledge

Tacit knowledge is not a single entity—it can be categorized according to its source and application:

### 1. **Somatic Tacit Knowledge**
- **Definition:** Physical skills or “muscle memory” internalized through repeated practice until actions become automatic.
- **Examples:** Riding a bike, touch-typing, using specialized machinery with precision.

### 2. **Relational Tacit Knowledge**
- **Definition:** Social skills and understandings acquired through interpersonal interactions, including reading social cues and unwritten rules.
- **Examples:** Building rapport with clients, managing team dynamics, interpreting unspoken feedback in meetings.

### 3. **Collective Tacit Knowledge**
- **Definition:** Shared assumptions, practices, and values that are embedded in a group, culture, or organization, often transmitted unconsciously.
- **Examples:** The way a high-functioning engineering team collaborates, the “vibe” of a startup, or regional business etiquette.

## Tacit Knowledge vs. Explicit and Implicit Knowledge

Distinguishing tacit knowledge from other knowledge types is fundamental in knowledge management and automation.

| Aspect             | Tacit Knowledge   | Implicit Knowledge         | Explicit Knowledge     |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Definition**     | Internalized, experience-based, hard to articulate | Unspoken, can be made explicit with effort | Documented, easily shared |
| **Expression**     | Difficult        | Possible with effort       | Straightforward       |
| **Transfer**       | Through observation, imitation, or mentoring | Through reflection and explanation | Through documents, manuals, databases |
| **Examples**       | Expert judgment, body language, knowing “what works” | Habits, unspoken assumptions | User guides, checklists, process documents |

**Key distinctions:**
- **Tacit Knowledge:** An expert’s intuition or “gut feeling” in critical moments—the kind of knowledge you can’t simply write down or teach by lecture.
- **Explicit Knowledge:** Clear, step-by-step procedures, policies, or data—anything that can be easily recorded and transmitted.
- **Implicit Knowledge:** Unconscious rules or habits (e.g., always greeting customers first), which can become explicit if reflected upon and articulated.

## Examples of Tacit Knowledge

### Workplace Examples

- **Sales:** A seasoned rep senses when a prospect is ready to commit, even before explicit signals are given.
- **Copywriting:** Intuitively choosing words and tone that drive higher engagement, not based on a formula but on accumulated experience.
- **Support:** Detecting the difference between a frustrated and a confused customer by tone and subtext, not just words.
- **Management:** Knowing which team members complement each other based on subtle cues and project history.

### AI & Automation Use Cases

- **Chatbot Development:** Training bots to replicate the empathetic, nuanced responses of expert support agents—deciding when to escalate or when to reassure.
- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):** Programming bots with “tricks” or shortcuts discovered by experienced operators that aren’t documented in manuals.
- **Knowledge Bases:** Enhancing documentation with video walkthroughs or case studies that reveal expert reasoning and contextual “know-how.”

### Everyday Life

- **Driving:** Applying just the right touch on brakes in an emergency—a skill only developed through practice.
- **Cooking:** Adjusting a dish’s seasoning by taste or texture rather than recipe instructions.
- **Sports:** Anticipating the next move in a game by reading the flow and body language of players.

## Importance of Tacit Knowledge in Organizations

Tacit knowledge is a vital organizational asset. Its presence and transferability can be a key differentiator for businesses.

### 1. **Competitive Advantage**
Organizations rich in tacit knowledge respond more adaptively to challenges, outperforming those that rely purely on formalized procedures and documentation.

### 2. **Knowledge Retention**
Capturing and sharing tacit knowledge helps organizations avoid critical loss when employees leave, retire, or change roles.

### 3. **Faster Onboarding**
New hires perform better and faster when they have access to not just “what to do,” but “how to do it well”—bridging the gap between theory and practice.

### 4. **Innovation and Problem-Solving**
Tacit know-how enables creative solutions and process optimizations beyond what’s written in manuals.

### 5. **Customer Satisfaction**
Leveraging tacit expertise allows for personalized, empathetic, and more effective customer service.
## Challenges in Managing Tacit Knowledge

While valuable, tacit knowledge is inherently challenging to manage:

- **Difficult to Articulate:** Employees might not even be aware of what they know, or lack the vocabulary to express it.
- **Inconsistent Transfer:** Without intentional processes, tacit knowledge may only spread sporadically or remain siloed.
- **Loss Through Turnover:** When experienced staff exit, their tacit knowledge often exits with them.
- **Context-Dependence:** Tacit knowledge is often tied to specific situations and may not generalize easily.
