## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems and software capable of executing tasks that require human intelligence. These tasks include language understanding, image recognition, decision-making, problem-solving, and even creative and autonomous actions. AI allows machines to analyze vast data sets, identify patterns, learn from experience, and adapt behavior, often at scales and speeds unattainable by humans.

<strong>Authoritative definitions:</strong>- *AI is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy* ([IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence)).
- *Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data sets* ([NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artificial-intelligence/)).

### Key Attributes of AI

- <strong>Learning:</strong>AI systems accumulate and process vast amounts of data to improve their performance over time.
- <strong>Reasoning:</strong>They draw logical conclusions or make predictions from data inputs.
- <strong>Adaptation:</strong>They adjust actions or outputs based on new data or feedback.
- <strong>Autonomy:</strong>They can execute tasks with minimal or no human intervention.

## How Does AI Work?

AI systems process large datasets using advanced algorithms. They identify patterns, make predictions, and refine their outputs through ongoing feedback and new data.

### Core Principles

- <strong>Data:</strong>AI relies on structured or unstructured data (e.g., text, images, audio) as the foundational input.
- <strong>Algorithms:</strong>Mathematical models or rules that process data, make decisions, and learn from outcomes.
- <strong>Learning from Experience:</strong>Through repeated exposure to data and feedback, AI models undergo *training* to improve accuracy.

<strong>Analogy:</strong>Training AI to recognize a cat involves supplying thousands of labeled images; the AI learns to distinguish cats in new, unseen images.

### Relationship Between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

- <strong>AI:</strong>The broad field focused on building systems that exhibit human-like intelligence.
- <strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong>A subset of AI, ML algorithms improve at tasks by learning from data, without being explicitly programmed.
- <strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong>A specialized area within ML, using multi-layered neural networks inspired by the brain to process complex, high-dimensional data.

*Illustration: Imagine three concentric circles—AI (outermost), ML (inside AI), DL (inside ML)—depicting the specialization hierarchy.*
