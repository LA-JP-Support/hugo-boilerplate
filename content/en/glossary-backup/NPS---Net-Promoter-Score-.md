## What is NPS (Net Promoter Score)?

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)** is a metric that quantifies customer loyalty by measuring how likely customers are to recommend a company, product, or service to others. It is built around a single survey question:

> “On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend [company/product/service] to a friend or colleague?”

Respondents are grouped as **Promoters** (9–10), **Passives** (7–8), or **Detractors** (0–6). The score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters, resulting in a value between -100 and +100.

**NPS is widely adopted across industries**—especially in SaaS, e-commerce, retail, financial services, and customer experience-driven sectors such as AI chatbot and automation. It is regarded as the gold standard for customer experience metrics ([Qualtrics NPS Guide](https://www.qualtrics.com/articles/customer-experience/net-promoter-score/), [Contentsquare Guide](https://contentsquare.com/guides/net-promoter-score/), [Pendo.io NPS Glossary](https://www.pendo.io/glossary/net-promoter-score-nps/)).

## NPS Key Terms & Components

### 1. Promoters

- **Definition:** Respondents scoring 9 or 10.
- **Behavior:** Loyal, enthusiastic, likely to recommend, and frequently become brand advocates.
- **Business Impact:** Drive growth through positive word-of-mouth and referrals.

### 2. Passives

- **Definition:** Respondents scoring 7 or 8.
- **Behavior:** Satisfied but unenthusiastic; vulnerable to competitors, unlikely to actively promote.
- **Business Impact:** Do not affect NPS directly but represent opportunities for conversion into Promoters.

### 3. Detractors

- **Definition:** Respondents scoring 0–6.
- **Behavior:** Unhappy, at risk of churning, may generate negative word-of-mouth.
- **Business Impact:** Lower your NPS and signal urgent areas for improvement.

## How to Calculate Net Promoter Score

The NPS calculation process consists of three steps:

### 1. Collect Responses

Distribute the NPS survey. Ensure the standard question is asked and responses are recorded on a 0–10 scale.

### 2. Categorize Respondents

- **Promoters:** 9–10
- **Passives:** 7–8
- **Detractors:** 0–6

### 3. Apply the Formula

\[
\text{NPS} = \% \text{Promoters} - \% \text{Detractors}
\]

Passives are included in the total respondent count but do not impact the score directly. For example, if out of 200 responses, 125 are Promoters (62.5%), 42 are Passives, and 33 are Detractors (16.5%), the NPS is 62.5 – 16.5 = **46**.

## How is NPS Used?

Organizations leverage NPS to:

- **Measure loyalty and satisfaction** after transactions or throughout the customer lifecycle.
- **Benchmark performance** against industry and regional standards.
- **Identify journey strengths and weaknesses** for product or service improvement.
- **Drive CX initiatives** by acting on direct customer feedback.
- **Track trends over time** and correlate with business changes.
- **Segment customers** for targeted engagement strategies.

**NPS is especially prevalent in:**  
- SaaS and software firms  
- E-commerce and retail  
- Financial services and banks  
- AI chatbot and automation platforms  
- B2B and enterprise services

## How to Interpret NPS Scores

### What Is a “Good” NPS?

- **Above 0:** Indicates more Promoters than Detractors (positive loyalty).
- **Above 50:** Considered excellent.
- **Above 70:** World-class, rare even among top brands.
- **Below 0:** More Detractors than Promoters—urgent action needed.

### Industry Benchmarks (2024)

Benchmarks are essential; what’s “good” varies dramatically by industry, business model, and geography. For example, according to the [2024 Qualtrics XM Institute NPS Ratings](https://www.qualtrics.com/m/www.xminstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/XMI_DataSnippet_XMICustomerRatings-NPS-2024-1.pdf?ty=mktocd-thank-you) and [Retently NPS Benchmarks 2025](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/):

Your own performance over time (internal benchmarking) is as important as industry averages (external benchmarking) ([Retently Benchmark Guide](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/)).

### Cultural and Industry Variations

- Rating habits differ by country (e.g., Japanese respondents tend to give moderate scores).
- Customer expectations vary; a 30 may be excellent in one field, subpar in another.
- Always compare scores to direct peers and consider regional nuances ([Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/articles/customer-experience/net-promoter-score/), [Retently](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/)).

## How to Collect NPS Feedback

### Survey Delivery Methods

- **Email:** After purchases, support interactions, or periodic check-ins.
- **Web/Onsite Pop-Ups:** On key website pages, after actions (checkout, signup).
- **SMS/Text:** For quick, mobile-friendly responses.
- **Phone/IVR:** Post-call customer service.
- **In-person:** At point-of-sale or events.

### Timing Strategies

- **Transactional NPS:** Immediately after a specific event.
- **Relationship NPS:** At regular intervals (quarterly, annually) for overall sentiment.

### Best Practices

- Always pair the rating with an open-ended question for context (e.g., “What is the main reason for your score?”).
- Segment results by customer type, product, region, etc.
- Avoid over-surveying; manage frequency to minimize fatigue ([Contentsquare Guide](https://contentsquare.com/guides/net-promoter-score/)).

## How to Use and Act on NPS Data

### 1. Analyze and Segment

- Break down NPS by customer segment, product, or interaction type.
- Identify patterns (e.g., Detractors clustered around a particular product or region).

### 2. Close the Feedback Loop

- Respond to Detractors quickly to resolve issues and mitigate churn.
- Leverage Promoters for testimonials, referrals, and advocacy.
- Investigate Passives to identify conversion opportunities.

### 3. Integrate with Other Metrics

- Combine NPS with **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)**, **CES (Customer Effort Score)**, churn rate, and behavioral analytics for a holistic view.

### 4. Track Over Time

- Monitor NPS trends and correlate with business changes (product launches, support updates).

### 5. Share Insights Internally

- Communicate findings organization-wide to foster a customer-centric culture ([Qualtrics NPS Guide](https://www.qualtrics.com/articles/customer-experience/net-promoter-score/), [Pendo.io NPS Glossary](https://www.pendo.io/glossary/net-promoter-score-nps/)).

## NPS vs. Other Customer Experience Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Key Question | Scale | Use Case | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|------------------|--------------|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **NPS** | Customer loyalty | "How likely are you to recommend us?" | 0-10 | Ongoing or post-interaction | Simple, benchmarkable, links to growth | Lacks context, can be gamed, not granular |
| **CSAT** | Satisfaction with specific event | "How satisfied were you with X?" | 1–5, 1–7 | After events | Actionable, event-specific | Not predictive of loyalty |
| **CES** | Ease of experience | "How easy was it to resolve your issue?" | 1–5, 1–7 | Post-support | Highlights friction points | Not holistic |

- **NPS:** Best for loyalty and benchmarking.
- **CSAT:** For tactical, point-in-time feedback.
- **CES:** For identifying process friction.

## Benefits of NPS

- **Simplicity:** One question yields actionable insights.
- **Benchmarking:** Standardized, enabling cross-industry and internal comparison.
- **Predictive Value:** High NPS correlates with retention and organic growth from referrals.
- **Alignment:** Easy to communicate and share across teams for a unified CX focus.

## Limitations and Challenges of NPS

1. **Lacks Context:** A single score reveals little without qualitative feedback.
2. **Cultural Bias:** Response styles differ globally, complicating comparison.
3. **Limited Granularity:** NPS summarizes overall loyalty, not specific pain points.
4. **Statistical Validity:** Requires large, representative sample sizes.
5. **Can Be Gamed:** Employees might selectively solicit happy customers.
6. **Not Diagnostic Alone:** Always supplement with open-ended questions and additional analysis.

- **Example:** Banks email NPS surveys after account opening; insights drive mobile app enhancements.

### AI Chatbot & Automation

- **Use:** Gauge chatbot effectiveness and automation satisfaction.
- **Example:** After chatbot use, present NPS survey; low scores prompt escalation to human agent.

### Employee Experience (eNPS)

- **Use:** Measure staff engagement and loyalty.
- **Example:** HR deploys eNPS surveys to monitor satisfaction and retention risk.
