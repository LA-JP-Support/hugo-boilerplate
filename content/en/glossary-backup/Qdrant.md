## Overview

Qdrant is an open-source vector similarity search engine and vector database, purpose-built for the storage, indexing, and retrieval of high-dimensional vector data—embeddings generated by machine learning and deep learning models. By allowing fast and scalable semantic search, recommendation systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), anomaly detection, and other AI/ML use cases, Qdrant addresses the unique needs of modern data-driven applications working with vast unstructured datasets. Qdrant is implemented in Rust, ensuring robust performance and memory safety, and is available both as open source and as a fully managed [cloud service](https://qdrant.tech/cloud/).

> **“Qdrant powers our demanding recommendation and RAG applications. We chose it for its ease of deployment and high performance at scale, and have been consistently impressed with its results.”**> —Srubin Sethu Madhavan, Technical Lead II at HubSpot

## What Is Qdrant?

Qdrant (pronounced "quadrant") is designed to:

- **Store**embeddings (vectors) representing the semantics of text, images, audio, video, and other data types.
- **Index**billions of high-dimensional vectors for low-latency retrieval.
- **Search**for vectors most similar to a query vector, using configurable distance metrics.
- **Support**hybrid search (semantic + keyword), multi-modal data (multi-vector per point), and payload-based filtering.

Qdrant’s Rust foundation provides high concurrency and efficient memory use. It offers a modern API supporting batch operations, filtering, hybrid queries, and advanced indexing features. For managed deployments, see [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/cloud/).

For a detailed hands-on introduction, see [A Developer's Friendly Guide to Qdrant Vector Database (Cohorte)](https://www.cohorte.co/blog/a-developers-friendly-guide-to-qdrant-vector-database) and the [official tutorials](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/database-tutorials/).

## Why Vector Databases Like Qdrant?

Traditional databases (relational or NoSQL) excel at storing structured data but are not designed for:

- **High-dimensional embeddings**(hundreds or thousands of dimensions from neural models).
- **Similarity search**("what is most similar to X?") using mathematical vector distance.
- **Unstructured and multi-modal data**, such as text, images, and audio.

Vector databases like Qdrant are optimized for querying by similarity, which is essential for modern AI/ML workloads: semantic search, recommendations, RAG, and more.

For a thorough explanation, see [What is a Vector Database? (Qdrant)](https://qdrant.tech/articles/what-is-a-vector-database/).

## Key Concepts and Terminology

### 1. **Vector (Embedding)**- **Definition:**A vector is an ordered list of numeric values, typically floats, representing the semantic features of an object (text, image, etc.) as produced by an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace, CLIP). Each number is a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. The vector “encodes” meaning or context, allowing for mathematical comparison.

- **Example:**- A 768-dimensional vector for a sentence.
  - A 1536-dimensional vector for a product description.

- **Types:**- **Dense vectors:**Most elements are non-zero; typically from transformer models.
  - **Sparse vectors:**Most elements are zero; common in keyword-based (BM25) search.

- **Use Case:**Representing items as vectors enables finding “similar” items via distance metrics, powering semantic search and recommendations.

> **Further reading:**### 2. **Point**- **Definition:**The atomic unit of data in Qdrant. Each point consists of:
  - **ID:**Unique key (integer or UUID).
  - **Vector:**High-dimensional embedding.
  - **Payload:**Optional, schema-less JSON metadata.

- **Analogy:**Like a "row" in SQL, but the primary data is a vector, not columns.

- **Example:**```json
  {
    "id": 123,
    "vector": [0.1, -0.2, 0.7, ...],
    "payload": {
      "category": "news",
      "author": "Alice",
      "timestamp": "2024-06-01"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Usage:**Points support filtering and faceted search via their payloads.

### 3. **Collection**- **Definition:**A named set of points (vectors + payloads) sharing the same dimensionality and distance metric. Analogous to a table in SQL.

- **Usage:**- Store item vectors in `products_collection`.
  - Store customer embeddings in `customers_collection`.

- **Configuration:**- Vector size (e.g., 768).
  - Distance metric (see below).
  - Storage type (RAM, memmap/on-disk; see [resource optimization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/vector-search-resource-optimization/)).
  - Quantization settings.

> [Qdrant Collections Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/)

### 4. **Distance Metric**- **Definition:**A function that measures the “similarity” between two vectors.

- **Supported in Qdrant:**- **Cosine similarity:**Measures the angle between vectors; common for text embeddings.
  - **Dot product:**Sensitive to both direction and magnitude; used in recommendations.
  - **Euclidean distance:**Straight-line distance; useful for image or sensor embeddings.
  - **Manhattan distance:**Sum of absolute differences; sometimes used for sparse data.

- **Example:**In document search, [cosine similarity](/en/glossary/cosine-similarity/) finds texts with similar meaning.

> [Distance Metrics Reference](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/#distance-metrics)

### 5. **Payload**- **Definition:**A flexible JSON object attached to each point, storing structured metadata: tags, categories, timestamps, raw text, etc.

- **Purpose:**Enables advanced filtering and faceted search. For example, filter search results by category or price.

- **Example:**```json
  "payload": {
    "category": "electronics",
    "brand": "Acme",
    "price": 199.99,
    "release_date": "2024-01-15"
  }
  ```

- **Indexing:**Fields can be indexed for fast lookup and filtering (see [Indexing](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/indexing/)).

> [Payloads in Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/payload/)

### 6. **Storage Options: RAM, Memmap (On-Disk), Quantized**- **RAM Storage:**Vectors are stored in memory; fastest for datasets that fit in available RAM.

- **Memmap (On-Disk) Storage:**Vectors are stored on disk and memory-mapped for efficient access, crucial for large datasets exceeding RAM.

- **Quantized Storage:**Vectors are compressed to use fewer bits (e.g., 8-bit, 2-bit), enabling much larger datasets at some trade-off in precision. See [Quantization Guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/quantization/).

> [Resource Optimization Strategies](https://qdrant.tech/articles/vector-search-resource-optimization/#storage-disk-vs-ram)
> [Storage Options in Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/storage/)

### 7. **Indexing (HNSW, Payload Indexes)**- **Purpose:**Accelerate similarity search for billions of vectors and enable fast metadata filtering.

- **Vector Index (HNSW):**- **Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW):**Graph-based index for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Offers logarithmic scaling, balancing speed and recall. Configurable via parameters `m`, `ef`, `ef_construct`.  
    For technical background: [HNSW Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320), [HNSW Indexing Fundamentals](https://qdrant.tech/course/essentials/day-2/what-is-hnsw/).
  - **Configuration Example:**Adjust `hnsw_ef` for search accuracy/speed trade-off.

- **Payload Indexes:**- Index specific fields (e.g., string, numeric, keyword) for fast filtering.  
    Example:  
    ```python
    client.create_payload_index(
        collection_name="products",
        field_name="category",
        field_schema="keyword"
    )
    ```
  - See [Indexing Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/indexing/).

- **Hybrid Indexing:**Combine vector search, sparse/keyword search, and payload filtering in a single query.

> [Indexing in Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/indexing/)

### 8. **Quantization**- **Definition:**Compresses vectors by representing them with fewer bits per value, allowing more vectors to be stored in RAM or on disk.

- **Techniques:**- Scalar quantization (e.g., 8-bit).
  - Binary/asymmetric quantization for extreme compression.
  - Qdrant supports several quantization strategies; see [Quantization Guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/quantization/).

- **Benefits:**Store up to 32x more vectors in the same space, with minimal accuracy loss when properly tuned.

- **Configuration:**Set `quantization_config` when creating a collection.

### 9. **Multitenancy**- **Definition:**Logical isolation of data for multiple users or projects within a single Qdrant instance.

- **Best Practice:**Use a single collection with a `tenant` field in the payload. Filter all reads/writes by the tenant ID. For advanced cases, see [Multiple Partitions Guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/multiple-partitions/).

### 10. **Hybrid, Dense, and Sparse Search**- **Dense Search:**Semantic similarity using dense embeddings (default in Qdrant).

- **Sparse Search:**Keyword-based search using sparse vector representations (e.g., BM25).

- **Hybrid Search:**Combines dense and sparse results using score fusion techniques such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) or DBSF. Supports multi-stage and multi-modal queries; see [Hybrid Search Revamped](https://qdrant.tech/articles/hybrid-search/) and [Hybrid Queries Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/).

- **Example Hybrid Query:**Combine results from dense and keyword searches to maximize both relevance and recall.

**How Qdrant Helps:**- Store vector embeddings for all items.
- Embed user query and search for vectors with high similarity (e.g., cosine).
- Supports batch search, filtering, and hybrid (semantic+keyword) queries.

**Example:**“Find FAQs semantically similar to this support ticket.”

**Code:**```python
results = client.search(
    collection_name="faq_collection",
    query_vector=query_embedding,
    limit=5
)
```

### **2. Recommendation Systems**

**Goal:**Suggest relevant items (products, content, users) based on learned similarity.

**How Qdrant Helps:**- Store embeddings for both users and items.
- Use dot product or cosine similarity to find best matches.

**Example:**“Recommend movies similar to what this user has watched.”

> [Vector Search Resource Optimization Guide](https://qdrant.tech/articles/vector-search-resource-optimization/)

### **3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

**Goal:**Feed relevant context to LLMs by dynamically retrieving supporting documents.

**How Qdrant Helps:**- Store embeddings for all documents.
- Embed user query and retrieve top-k results as LLM context.

> [RAG Example: Qdrant, Cohere, Airbyte, AWS](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/examples/rag-customer-support-cohere-airbyte-aws/)

### **4. Anomaly Detection**

**Goal:**Detect outliers or unusual patterns in high-dimensional data (e.g., fraud detection).

**How Qdrant Helps:**- Store historical event embeddings.
- Embed new event and find its nearest neighbors.
- Large distances from neighbors signal anomalies.

### **5. Multi-Modal Search and Clustering**

**Goal:**Work with text, images, and structured data together. Cluster items for categorization or analytics.

**How Qdrant Helps:**- Store multiple named vectors per point (e.g., image and text).
- Cluster using vector similarity and metadata filtering.

### **6. AI Agent Orchestration**

**Goal:**Enable distributed AI agents to share memory and coordinate actions.

**How Qdrant Helps:**- Store/retrieve contextual memory as vectors.
- Fast, filtered lookups for stateful AI agent systems.

## Example: Hands-On Integration

**Python Example:**```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

# Connect to Qdrant
client = QdrantClient("http://localhost:6333")

# 1. Create a collection
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="products",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=768, distance=models.Distance.COSINE)
)

# 2. Insert points (vector + payload)
client.upsert(
    collection_name="products",
    points=[
        models.PointStruct(
            id=1,
            vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...],
            payload={"category": "books", "author": "Alice"}
        ),
        # More points...
    ]
)

# 3. Search for similar vectors
query_vector = [0.15, 0.18, 0.28, ...]
results = client.search(
    collection_name="products",
    query_vector=query_vector,
    limit=3
)

for hit in results:
    print(hit.id, hit.payload)
```
