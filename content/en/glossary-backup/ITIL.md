## Definition

**ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)** is the world’s leading framework of best practices for managing IT services efficiently and aligning IT with business strategy. ITIL provides structured guidance to help organizations maximize the value of their IT investments, streamline processes, improve service quality, and drive innovation.

## What is ITIL?

ITIL is a comprehensive set of guidelines for IT Service Management (ITSM). It offers practical, proven solutions to:

- Plan, deliver, operate, and control IT services.
- Ensure IT supports and advances business objectives.
- Standardize service delivery and management processes.

ITIL is designed for flexibility. Organizations can adopt ITIL in full or partially, tailoring practices to their industry, size, and unique challenges. [Source: AuditBoard – ITIL Framework Overview](https://auditboard.com/blog/the-itil-framework-tips-and-tricks)

## Brief History of ITIL

**Origins:**  
Developed in the 1980s by the UK’s Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA), ITIL began as a way to ensure consistent, efficient IT service management across government agencies.

**Evolution:**

- **ITIL v1 (1989):** Over 30 volumes; focused on standardizing IT management.
- **ITIL v2 (2000):** Streamlined best practices and grouped processes for service support and delivery.
- **ITIL v3 (2007, refreshed 2011):** Introduced the IT service lifecycle, a holistic approach to continual improvement and business alignment.
- **ITIL 4 (2019):** Modernized for digital transformation, Agile, DevOps, and value co-creation.

**Stewardship:**  
Ownership transitioned from the CCTA to the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), then to AXELOS (a joint venture with the UK Cabinet Office and Capita PLC), and now is managed by PeopleCert.

## ITIL vs. ITSM and Other Frameworks

- **ITSM (IT Service Management):**  
  General philosophy and methodology for delivering IT as a service, covering all processes for IT service design, delivery, and improvement.
  [More on ITSM: Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm)

- **ITIL:**  
  Structured framework of best practices for implementing ITSM.

- **Other Frameworks:**
  - **COBIT:** Focuses on governance and control of enterprise IT.
    [COBIT Overview: ISACA](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit)
  - **ISO/IEC 20000:** The international standard for ITSM, to which many ITIL practices closely align.
    [ISO/IEC 20000 Details: ISO](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-20000-it-service-management.html)
  - **NIST CSF:** Cybersecurity risk management; ITIL complements NIST with detailed operational processes.
    [NIST CSF: NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

ITIL is most often used in combination with these frameworks, especially for governance, compliance, and risk management.

## Core Principles and Structure

### ITIL 4 Guiding Principles

ITIL 4 emphasizes seven guiding principles that shape modern ITSM:

1. **Focus on value:** Everything must deliver measurable value to stakeholders.
2. **Start where you are:** Build on existing processes and strengths.
3. **Progress iteratively with feedback:** Make continuous, incremental improvements.
4. **Collaborate and promote visibility:** Foster transparency and shared responsibility.
5. **Think and work holistically:** Consider the organization and its ecosystem as a whole.
6. **Keep it simple and practical:** Reduce complexity and prioritize practical solutions.
7. **Optimize and automate:** Refine processes and leverage automation for efficiency.

### ITIL 4 Structure: Service Value System (SVS) and Four Dimensions

#### Service Value System (SVS)

The SVS is the cornerstone of ITIL 4, integrating all components needed for value co-creation:

- **Guiding Principles** (above)
- **Governance:** Oversight and strategic direction.
- **Service Value Chain:** Operational model for service creation and delivery.
- **Practices:** 34 best practices covering all management domains.
- **Continual Improvement:** Ongoing refinement of services and processes.

[Service Value System Explained: AuditBoard](https://auditboard.com/blog/the-itil-framework-tips-and-tricks#highlights)

#### Four Dimensions of Service Management

1. **Organizations and People:** Capabilities, skills, structure, and culture.
2. **Information and Technology:** Data, knowledge, and enabling technologies.
3. **Partners and Suppliers:** Third-party and vendor relationships.
4. **Value Streams and Processes:** End-to-end workflows and value delivery.

## Key Practices and Processes

ITIL 4 organizes its 34 practices into three categories:

### 1. General Management Practices

- **Strategy Management**
- **Risk Management**
- **Continual Improvement**
- **Workforce and Talent Management**
- **Supplier Management**
- **Project Management**
- **Information Security Management**

### 2. Service Management Practices

- **Service Catalog Management:** Maintain a catalog of all available IT services.
- **Service Level Management:** Define and track service quality via SLAs.
- **Incident Management:** Restore services rapidly after interruptions.
- **Problem Management:** Identify and address root causes of recurring incidents.
- **Change Enablement:** Control risks during IT changes.
- **Service Request Management:** Handle routine user requests.
- **Service Continuity Management:** Ensure service availability during major incidents/disasters.
- **Capacity and Availability Management:** Maintain adequate resources and uptime.
- **Configuration Management Database (CMDB):** Track IT assets and relationships.

### 3. Technical Management Practices

- **Deployment Management:** Control software and infrastructure deployments.
- **Infrastructure and Platform Management:** Oversee IT environments.
- **Software Development and Management:** Manage software lifecycles.

#### Example: Incident vs. Problem Management

- **Incident Management:** Handles immediate disruptions (e.g., network outages) to restore normal service quickly.
- **Problem Management:** Investigates root causes to prevent recurrence, implementing permanent solutions.
