## What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the technology enabling computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. AI systems can identify objects, understand and respond to language, learn from new information and experience, make detailed recommendations, and act independently—sometimes replacing the need for direct human intervention (e.g., self-driving cars). ([IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence))

AI is not a single technology but an umbrella term for a range of computational methods and approaches that allow machines to perform and automate tasks requiring human-like intelligence. It encompasses subfields such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and robotics. These subfields empower AI systems to analyze data, recognize speech, interpret images, engage in conversations, make recommendations, and generate new content.

**Key takeaway:**AI refers to a collection of technologies and methods that enable machines to mimic, augment, or automate aspects of human cognition and perception, with the capacity to learn, adapt, and execute complex functions ([UF AI Glossary](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/c.php?g=1451497&p=10953235)).

## How Is Artificial Intelligence Used?

AI is embedded across a broad spectrum of industries and applications, both visible and behind the scenes. Its primary functions include automation, data analysis, decision support, content generation, and human-computer interaction. Below are key domains and examples:
