## What is Gumloop?

<strong>Gumloop</strong>is a modern, no-code platform for building intelligent automation workflows (“Flows”) powered by AI. Unlike traditional automation tools that rely solely on rigid, rule-based triggers and actions, Gumloop is <strong>AI-native</strong>: it was designed from scratch to deeply integrate large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT series and Anthropic’s Claude, into every layer of its automation engine.

### Core Functionality:

- <strong>Automated Workflows:</strong>Build sequences of tasks that span multiple apps and data sources, performed automatically or on demand.
- <strong>AI Agents:</strong>Deploy agents that interpret instructions in plain language, decide which workflows to run, and adapt their actions based on live context.
- <strong>Drag-and-Drop Builder:</strong>Design automations visually by connecting modular “nodes” on a canvas.
- <strong>Advanced Data Handling:</strong>Pull, process, and act on information across emails, spreadsheets, CRMs, web pages, and more.

> “Gumloop is an AI-native automation platform purpose-built for go-to-market (GTM) teams, revenue operations, and business development. It positions itself as a no-code solution for building AI-powered automations.”  
> — [Softailed review](https://softailed.com/blog/gumloop-review)

### What Sets It Apart?

- <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP):</strong>An open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data with natural-language scripting. [Learn about MCP scripting](https://www.gumloop.com/blog/a-different-take-on-mcp-introducing-mcp-scripting)
- <strong>Browser Automation:</strong>Chrome extension for direct, AI-powered web scraping and browser tasks.
- <strong>Custom Integrations:</strong>Use plain English to describe new automations; AI builds the backend logic.

## How Does Gumloop Work?

Gumloop operates through two main primitives: <strong>Workflows (Flows)</strong>and <strong>Agents</strong>.

### 1. Workflows (“Flows”)
- <strong>Visual Automations:</strong>Step-by-step sequences designed in a graphical builder.
- <strong>Nodes:</strong>Each step is a “node”—an action like reading a database, scraping a page, running an AI analysis, or sending an email.
- <strong>Triggers:</strong>Flows can start from a variety of events (webhooks, schedules, new data in an app) or manually.

#### Advanced Concepts:
- <strong>Subflows:</strong>Reusable, modular mini-workflows you can invoke from multiple parent Flows. Promotes code/data reuse and maintainability.
- <strong>Conditional Logic and Loops:</strong>Use if/then branches, batch processing, and error handling for robust automations.
- <strong>MCP Nodes:</strong>Custom nodes built via natural language prompts, leveraging the Model Context Protocol for accessing any compatible tool or dataset.

### 2. Agents

Agents are AI-powered orchestrators that:
- Interpret complex instructions (“Summarize all unread Gmail threads about project X and notify the ops team.”)
- Decide autonomously which Flows/Subflows to run and in what order.
- Handle context-aware tasks requiring reasoning, judgment, or multi-step problem solving.
- Can be embedded in Slack, Chrome, or triggered by API/webhooks.
