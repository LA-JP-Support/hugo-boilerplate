## Introduction

Digitalization is a foundational force shaping how businesses, organizations, and individuals operate. It harnesses computers, the internet, and modern digital technologies not just to convert analog data, but to optimize, automate, and reimagine processes, business models, and everyday experiences. This glossary presents a comprehensive, deeply-referenced exploration of digitalization: what it is, how it differs from digitization, automation, and digital transformation, its real-world applications, technology enablers, benefits, challenges, and broader societal impact.

## Core Definitions: Digitalization and Related Terms

Understanding digitalization means distinguishing it from closely-related concepts, as confusion is common even among professionals.

### Digitization

<strong>Digitization</strong>is the process of converting analog information—such as paper documents, photographs, or physical records—into a digital format that computers can process, store, and transmit.  
*Example: Scanning a paper invoice to create a PDF.*

- Digitization is foundational: it enables digital storage, easy access, and further processing, but does not by itself change business processes.

### Digitalization

<strong>Digitalization</strong>is the use of digital technologies and digitized data to improve processes, create new business models, and enhance experiences. It leverages digital data and tools to optimize workflows, enable real-time analysis, and create new value streams.
*Example: Using cloud-based platforms to manage inventory and analyze sales trends in real time.*

- Digitalization is broader: it is about process and business model improvement, not just data conversion.

### Automation

<strong>Automation</strong>is the use of technology (software, hardware, or both) to perform tasks or processes with minimal or no human intervention. It often builds on digitalized processes, increasing efficiency, accuracy, and speed.
*Example: An automated system that processes online orders and generates shipping labels without manual input.*

- Automation is typically a step after digitalization, using digital data to remove manual steps and increase speed and accuracy.

### Digital Transformation

<strong>Digital transformation</strong>is the comprehensive, strategic integration of digital technologies into all aspects of an organization, fundamentally changing operations, value delivery, and stakeholder engagement. It involves cultural, organizational, and operational change, enabled by digitalization and automation.
*Example: A traditional bank becoming a digital-first provider with AI-driven customer service, mobile banking, and personalized products.*

- Digital transformation is holistic and strategic, affecting the entire business model and culture.
