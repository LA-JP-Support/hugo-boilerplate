## Definition
<strong>Stack AI</strong>is an enterprise-grade, no-code/low-code platform for building, testing, and deploying AI-powered workflows and agents, centered around advanced large language models (LLMs). Stack AI enables organizations to connect disparate data sources and business systems, automate complex processes, and deploy AI assistants at scale—all without requiring deep programming expertise.

## What Is Stack AI?

Stack AI was founded by Antoni Rosinol and Bernardo Aceituno, both former MIT PhDs, to address the challenge of connecting business data with cutting-edge AI models. Stack AI targets enterprises needing secure, compliant, and scalable AI-driven operations. The platform provides a drag-and-drop interface for building modular automations, integrating LLMs, and orchestrating multi-step business workflows.

### Key characteristics

- <strong>No-code/low-code builder:</strong>Drag-and-drop workflow creation, modular steps, and plain English descriptions scaffold automation.
- <strong>LLM Integration:</strong>Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and Cohere models.
- <strong>Security/compliance:</strong>SOC2, HIPAA, and GDPR compliant (see [Security page](https://www.stack-ai.com/security)).
- <strong>Integration ecosystem:</strong>100+ SaaS, cloud, database, and API connectors.
- <strong>Flexible deployment:</strong>Cloud, on-premise, VPC, web, chat, API, Slack, Teams, embedded widgets.
- <strong>Enterprise focus:</strong>Designed for regulated industries and large-scale automation with granular access controls.
## How Is Stack AI Used?

### Core Usage Patterns

Stack AI streamlines knowledge-driven, repetitive, or labor-intensive business workflows by combining LLMs with a visual workflow builder:

- <strong>AI Agent Creation:</strong>Build custom chatbots, document analyzers, knowledge assistants, and “RAG” bots through a modular builder.
- <strong>Document Processing:</strong>Extract, classify, and process data from PDFs, contracts, spreadsheets, and more, at scale.
- <strong>Workflow Automation:</strong>Orchestrate business logic—e.g., ingesting emails, querying CRMs, generating reports, posting to Slack.
- <strong>Data Integration:</strong>Connect unstructured data from platforms like SharePoint, Salesforce, Notion, Snowflake, Google Drive, etc.
- <strong>Custom Interfaces:</strong>Deploy through web widgets, forms, Slack/Teams bots, or API endpoints.

<strong>Example workflow:</strong>Read PDF from Google Drive → Extract key data with OCR → Analyze with Claude or GPT-4 → Write summary to Salesforce → Notify team on Slack.

### Who Uses Stack AI?
