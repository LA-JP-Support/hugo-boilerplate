## What is Real-time Translation?

Real-time translation (RTT) refers to software that uses artificial intelligence (AI), neural machine translation (NMT), and natural language processing (NLP) to convert speech or text from one language to another instantly, as conversations occur. This enables fluid, multilingual communication in customer service, meetings, documentation, and any domain where language barriers exist.

- RTT is built on breakthroughs in deep learning, neural networks, and access to vast multilingual datasets. It powers everything from live subtitles in video calls to multilingual customer support chat and even simultaneous speech interpretation on wearable devices.
- RTT solutions are widely available, from consumer apps like Google Translate and Apple Translate to enterprise-grade platforms integrated into CRMs, helpdesks, and event software ([Smartling](https://www.smartling.com/blog/real-time-translation), [Localize](https://localizejs.com/articles/everything-you-want-to-know-about-real-time-translation)).
- The core promise is seamless, natural conversation—each party speaks or types in their language, but receives responses in real time, in their preferred language.

> “Real-time translation allows businesses, travelers, and even casual users to overcome language barriers.” ([Smartling](https://www.smartling.com/blog/real-time-translation))

## How Does Real-time Translation Work?

### Core Technologies

1. <strong>Neural Machine Translation (NMT):</strong>Today’s standard for instant translation. Instead of translating word-for-word, NMT models (like Google’s [Gemini Translation LLM](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/translate-llm?pli=1&inv=1&invt=Abm7vw)) process entire sentences, learning language patterns and context, resulting in more fluent, human-like output ([Smartling NMT Guide](https://www.smartling.com/resources/product/neural-machine-translation/)).
2. <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong>AI techniques that parse grammar, intent, sentiment, and language structure to improve translation quality, handling idioms, slang, and context ([NLP explained](https://localizejs.com/articles/natural-language-processing-nlp)).
3. <strong>Speech Recognition (ASR):</strong>Converts spoken words to text by analyzing audio waveforms ([Smartling](https://www.smartling.com/blog/real-time-translation)).
4. <strong>Text-to-Speech (TTS):</strong>Synthesizes translated text back into natural-sounding speech for voice-based RTT ([Smartling](https://www.smartling.com/blog/real-time-translation)).
5. <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SMLs):</strong>Recent innovations allow for highly specialized or lightweight models, further improving speed and accuracy for business use ([Smartling LLM Translation](https://www.smartling.com/resources/101/llm-translation/)).

### Process Overview: Text and Voice

<strong>Text-based RTT Flow:</strong>- User submits a message in their native language.
- System detects the language, processes it with NLP and NMT.
- Agent or recipient receives the message in their preferred language.
- Replies follow the same process in reverse.

<strong>Voice-based RTT Flow:</strong>- Speaker talks in their language.
- ASR converts speech to text.
- NLP/NMT translates text.
- TTS generates translated speech for the listener.
- Each party hears speech (or sees text) in their language, nearly instantly.

<strong>Example:</strong>Google Pixel Earbuds and Samsung Galaxy phones offer in-ear or on-device RTT, letting users converse in different languages with minimal delay ([Google Pixel Guide](https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/7573100?hl=en), [Samsung Live Translate](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10000935/)).

### Integration with Business Systems

- RTT platforms provide APIs or native integrations for CRMs, helpdesk, contact center, and collaboration tools.
- Platforms like [Wordly](https://www.wordly.ai/live-translation) enable live translation, captions, and transcripts for events and meetings, ensuring accessibility and compliance ([Wordly Overview Video](https://www.wordly.ai/videos/wordly-ai-translation-overview-video)).
- Secure, enterprise-grade RTT solutions offer features like on-premise processing, end-to-end encryption, and compliance modules for regulated industries ([Business Age Security Guide](https://www.businessage.com/post/secure-ai-translation-for-businesses-protecting-data-privacy-and-accuracy)).
