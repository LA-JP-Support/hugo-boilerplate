### Four Dimensions of Service Management

1. **Organizations and People:**Culture, roles, skills, and competencies.
2. **Information and Technology:**Data, information, tech, and tools supporting services.
3. **Partners and Suppliers:**Relationships and agreements with third parties.
4. **Value Streams and Processes:**Activities and workflows that deliver value.

### Seven Guiding Principles

| Principle                          | Description                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus on value                     | Everything should deliver value to stakeholders.                                                   |
| Start where you are                | Assess the current state before making changes.                                                    |
| Progress iteratively with feedback | Make changes in small steps, using feedback at each stage.                                         |
| Collaborate and promote visibility | Foster collaboration and transparency across teams and stakeholders.                               |
| Think and work holistically        | Address the service as an interconnected system for end-to-end value delivery.                     |
| Keep it simple and practical       | Avoid unnecessary complexity; deliver only what is needed.                                         |
| Optimize and automate              | Streamline and automate processes where feasible to maximize efficiency and reduce manual effort.  |

Each principle is designed to be universally applicable and supports continual improvement and strong alignment with business goals. ([IT Process Wiki Guiding Principles](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/ITIL_4#Service_value_system))
