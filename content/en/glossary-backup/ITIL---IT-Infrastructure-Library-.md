The SVS is the heart of ITIL 4, defining how all parts of an organization work together to create value through IT-enabled services. SVS components:

- <strong>Opportunity/Demand:</strong>Triggers for value creation activities.
- <strong>Guiding Principles:</strong>Core recommendations for effective action and decision-making.
- <strong>Governance:</strong>Organizational oversight, policies, and direction.
- <strong>Service Value Chain:</strong>Operational model guiding the creation, delivery, and continual improvement of services.
- <strong>Practices:</strong>Replaces previous "processes," offering sets of organizational resources for performing work.
- <strong>Continual Improvement:</strong>Ongoing process of identifying and acting on improvement opportunities.

([IT Process Wiki on ITIL 4](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/ITIL_4), [ITSM.tools ITIL 4 Explained](https://itsm.tools/itil-4-explained/))

### Four Dimensions of Service Management

1. <strong>Organizations and People:</strong>Culture, roles, skills, and competencies.
2. <strong>Information and Technology:</strong>Data, information, tech, and tools supporting services.
3. <strong>Partners and Suppliers:</strong>Relationships and agreements with third parties.
4. <strong>Value Streams and Processes:</strong>Activities and workflows that deliver value.

### Seven Guiding Principles

| Principle                          | Description                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus on value                     | Everything should deliver value to stakeholders.                                                   |
| Start where you are                | Assess the current state before making changes.                                                    |
| Progress iteratively with feedback | Make changes in small steps, using feedback at each stage.                                         |
| Collaborate and promote visibility | Foster collaboration and transparency across teams and stakeholders.                               |
| Think and work holistically        | Address the service as an interconnected system for end-to-end value delivery.                     |
| Keep it simple and practical       | Avoid unnecessary complexity; deliver only what is needed.                                         |
| Optimize and automate              | Streamline and automate processes where feasible to maximize efficiency and reduce manual effort.  |

Each principle is designed to be universally applicable and supports continual improvement and strong alignment with business goals. ([IT Process Wiki Guiding Principles](https://wiki.en.it-processmaps.com/index.php/ITIL_4#Service_value_system))
