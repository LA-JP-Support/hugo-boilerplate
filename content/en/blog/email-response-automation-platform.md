This article introduces revolutionary improvement methods for email handling, from efficiency techniques based on scientific approaches to integrated solutions that realize all of these on a single [platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.").

## Time Required for Business Email Inquiry Handling and Its Challenges

### Average Response Time and Field Reality

Business email inquiry handling requires far more time than imagined. According to research by the Japan Business Mail Association, reading one email takes an average of 1 minute 23 seconds, and composing a reply takes over 3 minutes. Business professionals processing 50+ emails daily are not uncommon, with cases spending over 2 hours daily just on email handling being frequent.

Particularly serious is the problem of spending most of the morning on email handling, unable to concentrate on core business tasks.

### Why Does It Take So Much Time?

The three main reasons inquiry handling takes time:

**1. Difficulty in Information Organization and Prioritization**

When multiple inquiries arrive simultaneously, numerous tasks arise for each case: judging urgency and importance, confirming past exchanges, and gathering related information.

**2. Burden of Non-Standard and Individual Responses**

Content that cannot be handled with templates and individual reply creation considering past exchanges require more time and effort.

**3. Complexity of Confirmation and Approval Flows**

When internal coordination or supervisor confirmation is needed, responses take time, keeping customers waiting.

### Field Example: Mornings End with "Email Handling Only"

At one manufacturing company, inquiry responses sometimes took an average of 3-5 days. Staff spent most mornings processing emails, falling into a vicious cycle of continued additional inquiries from customers and internal confirmation exchanges.

### Impact on Operational Efficiency and Customer Satisfaction

Response delays lead to decreased [customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m") satisfaction, reduced deal closure rates, and increased staff stress. The evaluation that "companies with quick responses are trustworthy" is a crucial element directly connected to business growth.

## Email Handling Efficiency Through Scientific Approaches

### Information Organization and Prioritization Theory

Efficient business email processing requires information organization and clear prioritization. According to [Pareto's Law](/en/glossary/Pareto's-Law/ "An empirical rule stating that 80% of overall results come from 20% of overall causes. In email handling, approximately 80% of all inquiries tend to concentrate on specific 20% of themes") (the 80:20 rule), approximately 80% of overall inquiries tend to concentrate on specific 20% of themes or questions.

Utilizing this law enables identifying frequent patterns and standardizing response methods. As a result, [cognitive load](/en/glossary/cognitive-load/ "The mental burden placed on the brain during work. Refers to the amount of attention and memory required when processing information") decreases and processing speed improves.

Additionally, psychological research shows that [multitasking](/en/glossary/multitasking/ "Performing multiple tasks simultaneously. Research shows this reduces work efficiency; email handling is more efficient when processed one at a time with concentration") reduces work efficiency. The method of handling email in concentrated batches at designated times, processing one at a time, is effective.

### Business Flow Visualization and Bottleneck Analysis

Visualizing email handling flow and identifying [bottlenecks](/en/glossary/bottlenecks/ "Points in business processes that take the most time or impose the greatest burden. Improving these points significantly enhances overall efficiency") (time and burden points) at each stage is the first step toward efficiency.

Representing the flow from inquiry reception through staff assignment, reply content creation, to sending in a flowchart clarifies which processes take time. In the business improvement field, bottleneck resolution is key to productivity enhancement.

### Concentration Peaks and Time Zone Utilization

Concentration and cognitive function are influenced by the body clock ([circadian rhythm](/en/glossary/circadian-rhythm/ "Physiological phenomena that fluctuate on approximately 24-hour cycles. Includes body [temperature](/en/glossary/Temperature--LLM-/ "A setting that controls how creative or predictable an AI's responses are—lower values [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") it more focused and consistent, while higher values [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") it more varied and imaginative."), hormone secretion, and sleep-wake cycles. The 2-3 hours after waking are considered cognitive function peaks")). Many studies indicate 2-3 hours after waking as the cognitive function peak.

Concentrating important email replies during this time improves processing quality and speed. Meanwhile, afternoons see easier energy decline, making it efficient to allocate less burdensome tasks like routine work and simple communications.

## Three Techniques for Efficient Email Reply

Three basic approaches are considered fundamental for email handling efficiency.

### 1. Template and Standard Text Utilization

Using pre-prepared templates for similar inquiries can significantly reduce reply time. However, template management and updates tend to become complex.

### 2. Automation Tool Implementation

Implementing tools for email sorting, auto-reply, [ticket management](/en/glossary/[ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m") support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,")-management/ "A system that manages customer inquiries and requests individually as 'tickets,' tracking response status and history"), etc. However, combining multiple tools is necessary, and inter-system coordination becomes a challenge.

### 3. Email Management Optimization

Using folders and labels for organization, setting automatic sorting rules, etc., clarifies priorities. However, setup and maintenance require effort.

## Key Points for Efficiency Without Compromising Quality

When advancing efficiency, the following two points are important:

**1. Manual and [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") Development**

Response standardization reduces errors and enables consistent level responses even from newcomers. However, creation and updates require considerable time.

**2. Maintaining [Personalization](/en/glossary/Personalization/ "Personalization is technology that automatically tailors products, services, and interactions to each individual based on their behaviors and preferences, without requiring manual setup.")**

Even when using templates, adding a line based on customer names and past exchanges avoids mechanical impressions.

## Importance of Internal Structure and Education

**[Knowledge Sharing](/en/glossary/Knowledge-Sharing/ "The systematic exchange of information, skills, and experiences between people and teams to improve collective learning and organizational performance.") Mechanisms**

Sharing success cases and response know-how across the organization reduces dependence on specific staff and standardizes response quality.

**Continuous Education**

Enhance member skills through e-learning and role-playing.

## Traditional Method Limitations: Challenges Individual Implementation Cannot Solve

The methods introduced so far are all effective. However, **attempting individual implementation faces four major barriers:**

### 1. Cost and Effort Problems

Template management, [ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a customer support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,") systems, chatbots, [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") systems... implementing each as separate tools inflates both initial and operational costs.

### 2. System Disconnection

Customer information scatters across multiple systems, making response history tracking difficult. Risks of duplicate responses and response gaps increase.

### 3. Learning and Adoption Difficulty

Mastering multiple tool operations takes time, increasing newcomer training burden.

### 4. Data Fragmentation

Data is managed separately in each tool, making overall analysis and improvement activities difficult.

**What's needed is an "integrated [platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.")."**

If there were a solution where necessary functions are consolidated into one system and fully coordinated, these challenges could be resolved at once.

The next [section](/en/glossary/Section/ "A container that groups related content or information together to organize and structure material into logical, manageable parts across documents, websites, and applications.") introduces "SmartWeb," the integrated [customer support](/en/glossary/customer-support/ "Customer support is a team and set of tools that help customers solve problems, answer questions, and get the most value from a product or service.") [platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") that realizes this ideal.

## Revolutionary Efficiency in Inquiry Handling with SmartWeb

### What is SmartWeb?

SmartWeb is a next-generation platform integrating [LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is customer service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and social media into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently.") ([ticket system](/en/glossary/Ticket-System/ "A system that manages customer inquiries and requests individually as 'tickets,' tracking response status and history")) and [FlowHunt](/en/glossary/FlowHunt/ "FlowHunt is a no-code platform that lets anyone build [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") chatbots and automate workflows by dragging and dropping blocks together, without writing code.") ([AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and make decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") automation). **It realizes all the efficiency techniques introduced in the previous chapter in one system.**
