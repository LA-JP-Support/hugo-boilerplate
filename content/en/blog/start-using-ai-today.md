In recent years, [AI implementation](/en/glossary/[AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.")-implementation/ "Incorporating [artificial intelligence](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") into business operations") for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has gained attention as a realistic option for achieving [operational efficiency](/en/glossary/Operational-Efficiency/ "Operational Efficiency is how well a company uses its resources like labor and materials to produce products or services at the lowest cost while maintaining quality. It measures a company's ability t") and [digital transformation](/en/glossary/digital-transformation/ "Transforming business processes and business models using IT and digital technologies").

Many SMEs face challenges such as "not knowing who handled what" and "missing responses" that arise from individually managing diverse inquiry channels—email, phone, SNS, and chat. The key to fundamentally resolving this confusion lies in implementing [AI chatbots](/en/glossary/[AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.")-[chatbot](/en/glossary/Chatbot/ "A computer program that simulates human conversation through text or voice, available 24/7 to automatically answer questions and assist users on websites and apps.")/ "A system where [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and make decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") automatically answers [customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m") questions"), [AI email auto-response generation](/en/glossary/AI-email-auto-response-generation/ "A feature where AI understands inquiry content and automatically creates response drafts"), and [ticket systems](/en/glossary/[Ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m") support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,")-System/ "A system that centrally manages inquiries and visualizes response status").

SmartWeb provides services combining the "[LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is [customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m") service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently.")" [ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a customer support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,") system used by over 40,000 companies worldwide with the "[FlowHunt](/en/glossary/FlowHunt/ "FlowHunt is a no-code [platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") that lets anyone build AI chatbots and automate workflows by dragging and dropping blocks together, without writing code.")" [automation [platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.")](/en/glossary/automation-[platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.")/ "A system platform that automatically coordinates and executes multiple business processes") utilizing the latest AI technology. AI handles [customer support](/en/glossary/customer-support/ "Customer support is a team and set of tools that help customers solve problems, answer questions, and get the most value from a product or service.") 24/7 automatically, creating response drafts for emails and inquiry forms. Staff simply review, modify, and send—eliminating the need to compose messages from scratch.

Additionally, AI learns from daily response data and grows smarter with use. Supporting approximately 100 languages including Japanese, English, and Chinese, it facilitates support for international customers.

Even if you think "It seems difficult without IT staff," rest assured. SmartWeb requires no specialized knowledge, with Japanese staff providing thorough support from implementation through operations.

Thus, AI implementation for SMEs has become a powerful means of simultaneously advancing customer service quality, [operational efficiency](/en/glossary/Operational-Efficiency/ "Operational Efficiency is how well a company uses its resources like labor and materials to produce products or services at the lowest cost while maintaining quality. It measures a company's ability t"), and digital transformation.

## Three Core Functions SmartWeb Provides

By implementing "[ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a customer support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,") systems," "AI email auto-response generation," and "AI chatbots," SMEs can achieve high-quality [customer support](/en/glossary/customer-support/ "Customer support is a team and set of tools that help customers solve problems, answer questions, and get the most value from a product or service.") previously available only to large enterprises. SmartWeb is chosen by many SMEs as an all-in-one service that even IT beginners can use with confidence.

### Ticket System: Centralized Inquiry Management

A [ticket system](/en/glossary/Ticket-System/ "A system that centrally manages inquiries and visualizes response status") is a mechanism that can centrally manage inquiries arriving from diverse channels—email, phone, SNS, chat, inquiry forms.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Multi-channel Centralization**: Manage inquiries from all channels on a single screen, eliminating response gaps
- **Information Sharing and Quality Improvement**: Immediately access past interactions, enabling smooth handoffs when staff changes
- **Automatic Recording and AI Utilization**: All interactions are automatically recorded and utilized as AI learning data
- **Flexible Work from Anywhere**: Being [cloud-based](/en/glossary/cloud-based/ "A service format accessed via the internet, independent of specific locations or devices"), responses are possible from remote work locations, on the go, or via smartphone
- **[Business Automation](/en/glossary/Business-Automation/ "Technology that handles repetitive business tasks automatically, reducing manual work and helping organizations operate more efficiently across departments.")**: Significantly reduce [response time](/en/glossary/Response-Time/ "Response time is the total duration between when a user makes a request and when they receive the complete result, serving as a key measure of how fast a system or application performs.") through automatic replies with standard templates for common questions and automatic assignment to staff

### AI Email Auto-Response Generation: Dramatically Reduce Staff Burden

[AI email auto-response generation](/en/glossary/AI-email-auto-response-generation/ "A feature where AI understands inquiry content and automatically creates response drafts") is a feature where AI automatically creates response drafts for questions from emails, inquiry forms, and SNS, presenting them to staff. Employees no longer need to compose messages from scratch, significantly reducing work time.

**AI Email Auto-Response Generation Process:**

**❶ Receive Email or Inquiry Form**
Following [automation rules](/en/glossary/automation-rules/ "Settings that automatically execute processes based on specific conditions") configured in [LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is customer service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and social media into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently."), AI retrieves the full email text. At this stage, [spam filtering](/en/glossary/spam-filtering/ "A feature that automatically identifies and appropriately classifies unwanted emails") automatically executes for not only general spam but also sales emails. Since response drafts aren't created for unnecessary emails, staff's wasted work is reduced.

**❷ AI Understands Questions and Creates Response Drafts**
For legitimate inquiries that pass spam filtering, AI understands the content and creates optimal response drafts based on pre-learned [knowledge bases](/en/glossary/knowledge-base/ "A database that systematically compiles knowledge and information within a company") and internal documents.

**❸ Display Response Draft as Memo on Operation Screen**
AI presents the response draft as a [note](/en/glossary/note/ "Internal memo displayed for staff within the ticket system") on the [LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is customer service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and social media into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently.") operation screen. Staff review the content and modify as necessary.

**❹ Further Improve Responses with AI Answer Assistant**
If needed, use the [AI answer assistant](/en/glossary/AI-answer-assistant/ "An AI feature that supports text refinement and adding explanations for technical terms") to refine text or add explanations for technical terms before replying.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Automated Spam Filtering**: Automatically identifies not only general spam but also sales emails, preventing unnecessary response draft creation
- **Significantly Reduced Work Time**: No need to compose from scratch—reply with just review and modification
- **Standardized Response Quality**: AI presents consistent quality response drafts, reducing variations in staff responses
- **Multilingual Support**: AI trained in Japanese supports approximately 100 languages, enabling immediate response to international customers
- **[Continuous Learning](/en/glossary/continuous-learning/ "An AI system that learns and improves continuously from new data without forgetting previous knowledge, adapting to changing conditions like humans do over time.")**: AI learns from daily response data, improving answer accuracy

### AI Chatbot: 24/7 Automated Response

An [AI [chatbot](/en/glossary/Chatbot/ "A computer program that simulates human conversation through text or voice, available 24/7 to automatically answer questions and assist users on websites and apps.")](/en/glossary/AI-[chatbot](/en/glossary/Chatbot/ "A computer program that simulates human conversation through text or voice, available 24/7 to automatically answer questions and assist users on websites and apps.")/ "A system where AI automatically answers customer questions") is a system where AI handles [customer support](/en/glossary/customer-support/ "Customer support is a team and set of tools that help customers solve problems, answer questions, and get the most value from a product or service.") automatically 24/7. It responds immediately even outside business hours, late at night, or on holidays, significantly improving customer satisfaction.

**Key Benefits:**

- **24/7 Automated Response**: AI operates constantly, responding immediately even outside business hours
- **Complete [Integration](/en/glossary/Integration/ "Integration connects different software and data sources so they work together seamlessly, allowing chatbots and automation tools to share information and operate as one unified system.") with Ticket System**: AI chat interactions are automatically recorded, with smooth handoff to human staff with one click for complex questions
- **Seamless [Customer Experience](/en/glossary/Customer-Experience---CX-/ "Customer Experience (CX) is the overall impression customers form from all their interactions with a brand—from discovering it, making a purchase, to getting support—which directly affects their loyal")**: Customers receive high-quality support without being aware of differences between AI and humans
- **Multilingual Support**: AI trained in Japanese automatically supports approximately 100 languages, enabling low-cost support for international customers
- **[Continuous Learning](/en/glossary/continuous-learning/ "An AI system that learns and improves continuously from new data without forgetting previous knowledge, adapting to changing conditions like humans do over time.")**: AI learns from daily response data, expanding answer scope
