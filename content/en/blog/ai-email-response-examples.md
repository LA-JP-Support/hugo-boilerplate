### "Does AI-powered automated response generation really work?" "Can it only produce template-like replies?"

Many of you may have these questions.

In fact, automated response generation using the latest [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") technology can handle far more sophisticated tasks than you might imagine. In this article, we'll thoroughly examine its capabilities and key implementation points by showing you actual samples of [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.")-generated responses.

## First, Let's Look at Real Examples

Seeing is believing. First, let's introduce two real examples of what kind of response drafts the [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") automated response generation function actually creates.

### 【Example 1】Handling Complex Technical Inquiries

**Customer Inquiry Content:**

From Mr. Yamada at XX Corporation, we received detailed questions regarding consideration of [AI [chatbot](/en/glossary/Chatbot/ "A computer program that simulates human conversation through text or voice, available 24/7 to automatically answer questions and assist users on websites and apps.")](/en/glossary/AI-chatbot/ "Explore AI chatbots: learn what they are, how they work with NLP, NLU, and [LLMs](/en/glossary/large-language-models/ "Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language, powering applications like chatbots, translation, and content creation."), their types, benefits, use cases, and best practices for deployment.") plan implementation:

- Minimum required content volume (number of [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") items, [knowledge base](/en/glossary/knowledge-base/ "A database that systematically compiles knowledge such as [frequently asked questions](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") and product information") pages, character count guidelines)
- Recommended content volume and industry-specific differences
- Learnable content formats (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
- Feasibility of importing existing website [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") pages
- Initial implementation accuracy and feasibility of gradual content increases
- Implementation possibility with current content holdings (approximately 50 [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") items, approximately 100 manual pages, approximately 200 inquiry cases)

 

**AI-Generated Response:**

The AI accurately understood these multiple questions and automatically generated the following structured reply:

1. **Regarding Minimum Required Content Volume**
   Clearly responded that the customer's current content volume (approximately 50 FAQ items, approximately 100 manual pages, approximately 200 inquiry cases) is sufficient for implementation

2. **Regarding Recommended Content Volume**
   While explaining differences by industry and use case, conveyed that effective operation can be expected with the customer's content

3. **Regarding Content Formats**
   - File formats such as PDF, Word, Excel

### 【Example 2】Sincere Response to Complaint Handling

**Customer Inquiry Content:**

From Mr. Yamada at XX Corporation, we received an urgent complaint regarding system malfunctions:

- Email inquiries not automatically converting to [tickets](/en/glossary/[ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a customer support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,")/ "A unit for managing customer inquiries as individual cases. Can record progress status and response history") (approximately 30% conversion rate)
- Completed ticket statuses automatically reverting to "unresponded"
- SNS inquiries being double-ticketed
- Receiving complaints from multiple customers
- Discrepancy from advertised "zero response gaps" and "unified management"
- Requesting reply within today

**AI-Generated Response:**

The AI understood the seriousness of this complaint and automatically generated the following sincere response:

1. **Recognition of Problem Severity**

   Promised communication of detailed investigation results and recovery timeline within today
   Also announced proposal of permanent recurrence prevention measures

6. **Expression of Apology and Sincerity**
   Clear apology stating "we sincerely apologize"
   Expression of empathy from customer's perspective

**Key Points of This Example:**

**Accurately Understanding Situation Severity**
Recognized this not as mere malfunction report but as emergency situation with severe impact on customer operations, creating appropriate response draft accordingly.

**Concrete and Practical Proposals**
Rather than just abstract apologies, specifically presented temporary workarounds and future response plans.

**Human-like Empathy and Sincerity**
The sincerity of the text, written from the customer's perspective, is hard to believe was AI-generated. Rather than formulaic apologies, it's written in an appropriate tone suited to the situation.

## Features of AI-Powered Automated Response Generation

### 1. Simultaneous Understanding and Processing of Multiple Questions

Traditional automated reply systems were limited to returning one answer to one question. However, modern AI systems:

- Simultaneously understand multiple question items
- Structure appropriate responses to each
- Automatically supplement related information
- Provide individualized responses suited to customer background and situation

In Example 1, it automatically generated a comprehensive structured response to a complex inquiry containing 6 major items and multiple sub-items without omission.

### 2. Appropriate Tone and Content Based on Situation

AI doesn't just return information but:

- Judges inquiry urgency
- Selects appropriate business document tone
- Provides sincere apologies and concrete countermeasures for complaints
- Offers detailed yet understandable explanations for technical questions

In Example 2's complaint handling, it understood situation severity and created responses with appropriate structure: apology, current situation explanation, temporary measures, and future plans.

### 3. Utilization of Rich Knowledge Base

AI automatically extracts related information from pre-learned content:

- FAQs, manuals, past inquiry cases
- Website FAQ pages
- [YouTube](/en/glossary/YouTube/ "YouTube is the world's largest video-sharing platform where people upload, watch, and share videos on any topic, and creators can earn money through ads and subscriptions.") videos and audio content
- Regularly auto-updated latest information

In Example 1, it automatically cited specific numbers from implementation examples and four related knowledge base articles.

### 4. Support for All Reception Channels

Centrally manages inquiries from all reception channels—email, contact forms, SNS ([Facebook](/en/glossary/Facebook/ "A global social network where billions of people share photos, messages, and updates to connect with friends, family, and communities."), [Instagram](/en/glossary/Instagram/ "A photo and video sharing app where people connect, share moments, and discover content from friends and creators worldwide."), X (Twitter), etc.), phone, chat—creating response drafts with the same high [precision](/en/glossary/Precision/ "Precision measures how often an AI model's positive predictions are actually correct. It's essential for applications like fraud detection where false alarms are costly.").

### 5. Automated Spam Filtering

Automatically identifies not only common spam but also sales emails, preventing unnecessary response draft creation. This allows staff to focus only on truly important inquiries.

## Real Implementation Results

Companies that have actually implemented AI-powered automated response generation report the following results:

### CVFR Travel Group Case Study

- **First Contact Resolution**: Improved 28%
- **[Response Time](/en/glossary/Response-Time/ "Response time is the total duration between when a user makes a request and when they receive the complete result, serving as a key measure of how fast a system or application performs.")**: Reduced from 1 hour to 20 minutes

Thus, AI-powered automated response generation is not merely "reply automation" but simultaneously achieves **improved customer satisfaction** and **dramatic [operational efficiency](/en/glossary/Operational-Efficiency/ "Operational Efficiency is how well a company uses its resources like labor and materials to produce products or services at the lowest cost while maintaining quality. It measures a company's ability t") improvements**.

## Operational Considerations and Best Practices

### Tasks Suited for AI vs. Human Handling

#### **Tasks Suited for AI:**

- Responses to routine questions (FAQ, manual verification, etc.)
- Information provision (shipping status, business hours, pricing information, etc.)
- Initial inquiry responses
- Automated replies outside business hours

#### **Tasks Requiring Human Handling:**

- Cases requiring complex negotiations
- Complaint handling requiring particular emotional consideration
- Highly individual special requests
- Important decisions involving contracts or amounts

In Example 2's complaint handling, while AI created an appropriate initial response draft, having human staff perform final confirmation before sending for such important cases achieves perfect handling.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
