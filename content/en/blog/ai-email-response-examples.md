### "Does AI-powered automated response generation really work?" "Can it only produce template-like replies?"

Many of you may have these questions.

In fact, automated response generation using the latest AI technology can handle far more sophisticated tasks than you might imagine. In this article, we'll thoroughly examine its capabilities and key implementation points by showing you actual samples of AI-generated responses.

## First, Let's Look at Real Examples

Seeing is believing. First, let's introduce two real examples of what kind of response drafts the AI automated response generation function actually creates.

Note that the system introduced here combines {{< tooltip text="A ticket system that can manage various inquiries from email, SNS, and other channels in one place" >}}LiveAgent{{< /tooltip >}} with {{< tooltip text="An AI chatbot platform that integrates and utilizes multiple AI models" >}}FlowHunt{{< /tooltip >}}, which is also utilized in SmartWeb's construction services. It handles not only emails but also inquiries from contact forms and SNS, creating equally high-precision response drafts across all reception channels.

### 【Example 1】Handling Complex Technical Inquiries

**Customer Inquiry Content:**

From Mr. Yamada at XX Corporation, we received detailed questions regarding consideration of AI chatbot plan implementation:

- Minimum required content volume (number of FAQ items, {{< tooltip text="A database that systematically compiles knowledge such as frequently asked questions and product information" >}}knowledge base{{< /tooltip >}} pages, character count guidelines)
- Recommended content volume and industry-specific differences
- Learnable content formats (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
- Feasibility of importing existing website FAQ pages
- Initial implementation accuracy and feasibility of gradual content increases
- Implementation possibility with current content holdings (approximately 50 FAQ items, approximately 100 manual pages, approximately 200 inquiry cases)
- Reference information on effects in implementation examples

 

**AI-Generated Response:**

The AI accurately understood these multiple questions and automatically generated the following structured reply:

1. **Regarding Minimum Required Content Volume**
   Clearly responded that the customer's current content volume (approximately 50 FAQ items, approximately 100 manual pages, approximately 200 inquiry cases) is sufficient for implementation

2. **Regarding Recommended Content Volume**
   While explaining differences by industry and use case, conveyed that effective operation can be expected with the customer's content

3. **Regarding Content Formats**
   - File formats such as PDF, Word, Excel
   - Website FAQ pages, LiveAgent knowledge base
   - YouTube videos, audio content
   - Automatic acquisition and periodic updates via {{< tooltip text="A function that automatically acquires website information and updates it periodically" >}}URL Retriever{{< /tooltip >}}
   
   Specifically listed these options and clearly indicated that importing existing FAQ pages is possible

4. **Regarding Initial Accuracy and Gradual Operation**
   Explained that gradual implementation is possible
   Proposed starting with necessary functions and gradually expanding the scope of utilization

5. **Introduction of Implementation Examples**
   Presented specific results from CVFR Travel Group ({{< tooltip text="The percentage of customer inquiries resolved on first contact. Higher percentages indicate higher customer satisfaction" >}}first contact resolution{{< /tooltip >}} improved by 28%, response time reduced from 1 hour to 20 minutes)
   Suggested detailed guidance through free consultation

6. **Provision of Reference URLs**
   Automatically attached links to four related knowledge base articles

**Key Points of This Example:**

**Accurately Understanding Multiple Questions**
The customer's inquiry contained 6 major items and multiple sub-items, but the AI understood all without omission and created a structured reply.

**Responses Tailored to Customer Situation**
Based on specific numbers like "approximately 50 FAQ items, approximately 100 manual pages," it achieved individualized response judging this as "sufficient for implementation."

**Natural and Polite Business Document**
Rather than template-like standard text, it generated polite and specific responses in natural Japanese appropriate to the situation.

### 【Example 2】Sincere Response to Complaint Handling

**Customer Inquiry Content:**

From Mr. Yamada at XX Corporation, we received an urgent complaint regarding system malfunctions:

- Email inquiries not automatically converting to {{< tooltip text="A unit for managing customer inquiries as individual cases. Can record progress status and response history" >}}tickets{{< /tooltip >}} (approximately 30% conversion rate)
- Completed ticket statuses automatically reverting to "unresponded"
- SNS inquiries being double-ticketed
- Receiving complaints from multiple customers
- Discrepancy from advertised "zero response gaps" and "unified management"
- Requesting reply within today

**AI-Generated Response:**

The AI understood the seriousness of this complaint and automatically generated the following sincere response:

1. **Recognition of Problem Severity**
   Clearly positioned as "critical malfunction affecting system fundamentals"
   Expressed recognition of serious impact on customer operations

2. **Explanation of Support Structure**
   Explained dual support structure from developer and own company
   Indicated rapid response posture

3. **Current Response Status**
   Explained that cause investigation is underway with highest priority
   Reported progress of emergency response by technical team
   Provided real-time status page (https://status.liveagent.com/)

4. **Proposal of Temporary Workarounds**
   Manual ticket creation for important inquiries
   Manual management of completed ticket statuses

5. **Future Response Plan**
   Promised communication of detailed investigation results and recovery timeline within today
   Also announced proposal of permanent recurrence prevention measures

6. **Expression of Apology and Sincerity**
   Clear apology stating "we sincerely apologize"
   Expression of empathy from customer's perspective

**Key Points of This Example:**

**Accurately Understanding Situation Severity**
Recognized this not as mere malfunction report but as emergency situation with severe impact on customer operations, creating appropriate response draft accordingly.

**Concrete and Practical Proposals**
Rather than just abstract apologies, specifically presented temporary workarounds and future response plans.

**Human-like Empathy and Sincerity**
The sincerity of the text, written from the customer's perspective, is hard to believe was AI-generated. Rather than formulaic apologies, it's written in an appropriate tone suited to the situation.

## Features of AI-Powered Automated Response Generation

### 1. Simultaneous Understanding and Processing of Multiple Questions

Traditional automated reply systems were limited to returning one answer to one question. However, modern AI systems:

- Simultaneously understand multiple question items
- Structure appropriate responses to each
- Automatically supplement related information
- Provide individualized responses suited to customer background and situation

In Example 1, it automatically generated a comprehensive structured response to a complex inquiry containing 6 major items and multiple sub-items without omission.

### 2. Appropriate Tone and Content Based on Situation

AI doesn't just return information but:

- Judges inquiry urgency
- Selects appropriate business document tone
- Provides sincere apologies and concrete countermeasures for complaints
- Offers detailed yet understandable explanations for technical questions

In Example 2's complaint handling, it understood situation severity and created responses with appropriate structure: apology, current situation explanation, temporary measures, and future plans.

### 3. Utilization of Rich Knowledge Base

AI automatically extracts related information from pre-learned content:

- FAQs, manuals, past inquiry cases
- Website FAQ pages
- YouTube videos and audio content
- Regularly auto-updated latest information

In Example 1, it automatically cited specific numbers from implementation examples and four related knowledge base articles.

### 4. Support for All Reception Channels

Centrally manages inquiries from all reception channels—email, contact forms, SNS (Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), etc.), phone, chat—creating response drafts with the same high precision.

### 5. Automated Spam Filtering

Automatically identifies not only common spam but also sales emails, preventing unnecessary response draft creation. This allows staff to focus only on truly important inquiries.

## Real Implementation Results

Companies that have actually implemented AI-powered automated response generation report the following results:

### CVFR Travel Group Case Study

- **First Contact Resolution**: Improved 28%
