# Monday Morning Nightmare: Before Drowning in a Sea of Emails

"Good morning! Did you check the weekend inquiries?"
Have you ever been startled by this question from staff first thing Monday morning?
You frantically open your email inbox to find a mountain of inquiries that have piled up since Friday evening. You open your Excel management sheet and desperately check "Handled" and "Pending" statuses. Wait, is Tanaka-san handling this inquiry, or am I?
Before you know it, the morning is over and your actual work remains untouched...
**In fact, this scene is happening in small businesses all across Japan.**

## Shocking Truth: 60% of Inquiry Handling is Still "Manual"

### Invisible Losses Are Accumulating

According to research, approximately **60%** of inquiry handling is still done manually. And about **70%** of companies have experienced "response errors and oversights due to insufficient information sharing."

Let's think concretely about what this means:

#### 【Case 1: The Tragedy of Duplicate Response】

Friday evening, a customer emails about a "product defect." Yamada-san thinks he replied, but Monday morning Suzuki-san also replies to the same email. The customer feels distrustful: "Why two emails from the same company? Can't you manage properly?"

#### 【Case 2: The Handover Pitfall】

The assigned Sato-san suddenly calls in sick. "How far did we get with that customer's case?" Even after digging through emails, the history is unclear and confirmation starts from scratch. The customer gets irritated: "I already explained this before..."

#### 【Case 3: Priority Misjudgment】

When multiple inquiries come in simultaneously, which should be handled first? As a result, high-urgency cases get pushed back, leading to the loss of major customers...

### 30% of Customers Leave Due to "Slow Response"

There's even more shocking data. Recent surveys show that delays in customer response and declining service quality are reasons why approximately **30%** of customers leave.

In other words, improving inquiry management isn't something you "should do" - it's a "must do to survive" level challenge.

## {{< tooltip text="A system that treats inquiries and support requests as numbered management tickets, centrally managing assigned staff and progress status" >}}Ticket System{{< /tooltip >}} - The "Magic Wand"

### What Exactly is a "Ticket System"?

It might sound complicated, but it's actually simple.

> Ticket System = A mechanism to manage all inquiries as "numbered slips"

It's like when a restaurant takes an order, writes it on a slip, and sends it to the kitchen.

- Email inquiry → Ticket #001
- Phone consultation → Ticket #002
- SNS DM or comment → Ticket #003
- Quote request from inquiry form → Ticket #004

Everything gets a number, and you can see at a glance "who," "when," and "what" was handled.

### Amazing Results: Actual Company Outcomes

At SmartWeb, we use {{< tooltip text="Customer support and help desk software used worldwide. It can centrally manage inquiries from email, chat, phone, SNS, and other channels" >}}{{< tooltip text="Inquiry ticket management system" >}}LiveAgent{{< /tooltip >}}{{< /tooltip >}}, a proven ticket system.

#### Results from companies that implemented LiveAgent:

- First contact resolution rate: **28% improvement**
- Response time: Reduced from 1 hour to **20 minutes**
- Response oversights: **Nearly zero**

Voice from a small business owner:
**"Before implementation, every day was panic mode. But now, I can see the status of all inquiries on the screen. Response speed doubled and complaints drastically decreased."**

## {{< tooltip text="A website or system that aggregates information like FAQs, manuals, and guides so customers can solve problems themselves" >}}Support Portal{{< /tooltip >}}: The "Magic Bookshelf" for Customer Self-Service

### 30-52% of Inquiries Disappear!?

A "Support Portal" is like a "customer-dedicated library" that organizes {{< tooltip text="Frequently Asked Questions - content that compiles questions commonly asked by customers and their answers" >}}FAQs{{< /tooltip >}} and manuals.

In fact, **30-52%** of inquiries are things customers can resolve themselves if they have the right information (according to Gartner research).

#### Common self-resolvable inquiries:

- What are your business hours?
- How do I return items?
- I forgot my password
- I don't know how to use it
- I want to know about pricing plans
- How do I change account information?
- How do I check order/delivery status?
- What payment methods are available?
- Is there a warranty?
- Is a contract required?
- Where are your physical stores located?
- How do I check my order number?
- How do I upgrade (change plans)?
- How do I adjust privacy settings or delete my account?
- What services do you provide?
- How do I contact support?

By providing this information 24/7/365, you can reduce late-night and weekend inquiries, allowing staff to focus on truly complex cases that require human attention.

## "3 Secrets" Practiced by Successful Companies

### 1. Company-wide Implementation

Successful companies share the meaning of implementation with everyone, not just some people. It's important that everyone understands "why we're implementing this" and "what benefits it brings."

### 2. Start Small, Grow Big

Don't try to perfect everything from the start - begin with basic functions. Gradually add features as you get comfortable.

### 3. Continuous Improvement Through Data Analysis

Check data monthly. Analyze "what types of inquiries are common?" and "did response times improve?" for continuous improvement.

## Start Now or Fall Behind Competitors

The wave of {{< tooltip text="Introducing digital technology into business processes to improve efficiency and drive transformation" >}}digitalization{{< /tooltip >}} isn't just for large corporations.
