# Monday Morning Nightmare: Before Drowning in a Sea of Emails

"Good morning! Did you check the weekend inquiries?"
Have you ever been startled by this question from staff first thing Monday morning?
You frantically open your email inbox to find a mountain of inquiries that have piled up since Friday evening. You open the Excel management sheet and desperately check "Handled" and "Pending." Wait, is Tanaka-san handling this inquiry, or am I?
Before you know it, the morning is over and your actual work remains untouched...
**In fact, this scene is happening at small businesses all across Japan.**

## Shocking Fact: 60% of Inquiry Handling Is Still "Manual"

### Invisible Losses Are Accumulating

According to research, approximately **60%** of inquiry handling is still done manually. And about **70%** of companies have experienced "response errors and oversights due to insufficient information sharing."

Let's think concretely about what this means:

#### 【Case 1: The Tragedy of Duplicate Responses】

Friday evening, a customer emails about a "product defect." Yamada-san thinks he replied, but Monday morning Suzuki-san also replies to the same email. The customer feels distrustful: "Why two emails from the same company? Can't you manage properly?"

#### 【Case 2: The Handover Pitfall】

The assigned Sato-san suddenly calls in sick. "How far did we get with that customer's case?" Even after digging through emails, the background is unclear and we have to start from scratch. The customer gets irritated: "I already explained this before..."

#### 【Case 3: Priority Misjudgment】

When multiple inquiries come in simultaneously, which should be handled first? As a result, high-urgency cases get pushed back, leading to the loss of major customers...

### 30% of Customers Leave Due to "Slow Response"

There's even more shocking data. Recent surveys show that delays in customer service and declining service quality are the reason about **30%** of customers leave.

In other words, improving inquiry management isn't something you "should do" - it's a "do or die" level challenge for survival.

### What Is a "Ticket System" Anyway?

It might sound complicated, but it's actually simple.

> Ticket System = A mechanism to manage all inquiries as "numbered slips"

It's like when a restaurant takes an order, writes it on a slip, and sends it to the kitchen.

- Email inquiry → Ticket #001
- Phone consultation → Ticket #002
- SNS DM or comment → Ticket #003
- Quote request from inquiry form → Ticket #004

Everything gets a number, and you can see at a glance "who," "when," and "what" was handled.

### Amazing Results: Actual Company Outcomes

At SmartWeb, we use {{< tooltip text="Customer support and help desk software used worldwide. It can centrally manage inquiries from email, chat, phone, SNS, and other channels" >}}{{< tooltip text="Inquiry ticket management system" >}}LiveAgent{{< /tooltip >}}{{< /tooltip >}}, a proven ticket system with extensive track record.

#### Results from companies that implemented LiveAgent:

- First contact resolution rate: **28% improvement**
- Response time: Reduced from 1 hour to **20 minutes**
- Missed responses: **Nearly zero**

Voice from a small business owner:
**"Before implementation, every day was panic mode. But now, I can see the status of all inquiries on the screen. Response speed doubled and complaints drastically decreased."**

## {{< tooltip text="A website or system that aggregates information like FAQs, manuals, and guides so customers can solve problems themselves" >}}Support Portal{{< /tooltip >}}: The "Magic Bookshelf" for Customer Self-Service

### 30-52% of Inquiries Disappear!?

A "Support Portal" is like a "customer-exclusive library" that compiles {{< tooltip text="Frequently Asked Questions - content that organizes common customer questions and their answers" >}}FAQs{{< /tooltip >}} and manuals.

In fact, **30-52%** of inquiries are things customers can resolve themselves if they have the right information (according to Gartner research).

#### Common self-resolvable inquiries:

- What are your business hours?
- How do I return items?
- I forgot my password
- I don't know how to use it
- I want to know the pricing plans
- How do I change account information?
- How do I check order/delivery status?
- What payment methods are available?
- Is there a warranty?
- Is a contract required?
- Where are your physical stores located?
- How do I check my order number?
- How do I upgrade (change plans)?
- How do I adjust privacy settings or delete my account?
- What services do you provide?
- How do I contact support?

By providing this information 24/7/365, you can reduce late-night and weekend inquiries, allowing staff to focus on complex cases that truly require human attention.

## "3 Secrets" Practiced by Successful Companies

### 1. Company-wide Implementation

Successful companies share the meaning of implementation with everyone, not just some people. It's important that everyone understands "why we're implementing this" and "what benefits it brings."

### 2. Start Small, Grow Big

Don't try to perfect everything from the start - begin with basic functions. Gradually add features as you get comfortable.

### 3. Review Data and Continuously Improve

Check data monthly. Analyze "what types of inquiries are common?" and "did we reduce response time?" and continuously improve.

## If You Don't Start Now, Competitors Will Gain an Advantage
