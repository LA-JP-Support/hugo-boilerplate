## Definition and Role of Knowledge Base

A [Knowledge Base](/en/glossary/knowledge-base/ "A database that organizes and stores company knowledge and know-how, making it searchable for everyone. Like a company's 'knowledge warehouse'") is a collection of organized information that includes business knowledge, know-how, work procedures, troubleshooting examples, and success stories used within companies and organizations. It serves as an information infrastructure that allows anyone to quickly look up necessary information when needed.

Knowledge bases manage both [tacit knowledge](/en/glossary/tacit-knowledge/ "Knowledge and skills acquired through experience that are difficult to explain in words") (knowledge gained from experience) and [explicit knowledge](/en/glossary/explicit-knowledge/ "Knowledge recorded in visible forms such as documents and manuals") (knowledge documented in manuals and other materials) in a database format. They are designed to provide efficient access to information using mechanisms such as [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") search functionality, tagging, and hierarchical structures.

For example, they are useful in standardizing work procedures, preventing knowledge from being concentrated in specific individuals, and facilitating smooth onboarding of new employees.

## Differences Between [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "Frequently Asked Questions - a collection of common questions and their answers") and Knowledge Base
[FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "[Frequently Asked Questions](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") - a collection of common questions and their answers") ([Frequently Asked Questions](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.")) is content that compiles common questions from users or employees along with their answers. FAQ is positioned as part of a knowledge base.

While FAQ follows a simple format of paired "questions" and "answers," knowledge bases organize a broader range of information including detailed operation guides, business workflows, error response methods, and video explanations. FAQ is designed for quickly finding answers to specific questions, while knowledge bases also accommodate users who want to explore various information independently.

## Background and Value of Knowledge Base Utilization in 2025

In 2025, knowledge bases have incorporated [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A [no-code](/en/glossary/Low-Code-No-Code/ "Development platforms that let anyone build applications using drag-and-drop interfaces instead of writing code, enabling faster software creation with minimal programming knowledge.") platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.")-powered automatic classification and [natural language search](/en/glossary/natural-language-search/ "A feature that allows searching using natural language. Users can search with natural sentences like 'What should I do when I forget my password?'") capabilities, with continued expansion of remote work and efforts to improve [customer experience ([CX](/en/glossary/[Customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m")-Experience---CX-/ "[Customer Experience](/en/glossary/[Customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m")-Experience---CX-/ "[Customer](/en/glossary/Risk-Assessment--Customer-/ "A systematic process to evaluate potential risks associated with a customer, such as credit risk or fraud risk, to help organizations make informed decisions about lending, pricing, and relationship m") Experience (CX) is the overall impression customers form from all their interactions with a brand—from discovering it, making a purchase, to getting support—which directly affects their loyal") (CX) is the overall impression customers form from all their interactions with a brand—from discovering it, making a purchase, to getting support—which directly affects their loyal"))](/en/glossary/Customer-Experience---[CX](/en/glossary/Customer-Experience---CX-/ "[Customer Experience](/en/glossary/Customer-Experience---CX-/ "Customer Experience (CX) is the overall impression customers form from all their interactions with a brand—from discovering it, making a purchase, to getting support—which directly affects their loyal") (CX) is the overall impression customers form from all their interactions with a brand—from discovering it, making a purchase, to getting support—which directly affects their loyal")-/ "The quality of satisfaction and experience customers have when using services"). In this context, knowledge bases are treated as core assets for enhancing corporate competitiveness.

Research shows that approximately 70% of companies that implemented knowledge bases experienced "faster inquiry response," "improved [operational efficiency](/en/glossary/Operational-Efficiency/ "Operational Efficiency is how well a company uses its resources like labor and materials to produce products or services at the lowest cost while maintaining quality. It measures a company's ability t")," and "enhanced employee satisfaction and retention rates." For example, companies that established internal knowledge bases reduced new employee training periods by up to 30%, while those that enhanced customer-facing FAQs reduced support costs by 20%.

These results demonstrate that properly constructed knowledge bases can significantly improve overall company productivity, satisfaction, and [customer experience](/en/glossary/Customer-Experience---CX-/ "Customer Experience (CX) is the overall impression customers form from all their interactions with a brand—from discovering it, making a purchase, to getting support—which directly affects their loyal") quality.

## Practical Steps for Creating a Knowledge Base

This chapter provides step-by-step learning of basic knowledge base (FAQ) creation methods and key points for design and structuring.

### Clarifying Purpose and Target Audience

When creating a knowledge base, first clarify "what it's for" and "who will use it." For example, internal purposes might include supporting new employees or reducing inquiries, while customer-facing purposes might focus on improving self-resolution rates. The necessary information and presentation methods vary depending on the purpose. Design with specific consideration of target users' skill levels and usage [scenarios](/en/glossary/scenarios/ "A pre-written conversation blueprint that guides how a chatbot responds to users and performs actions to achieve specific business goals.").

### Information Collection and Organization

Next, collect information to be included in the knowledge base. Main collection methods include:

- Investigating internal documents, manuals, and past inquiry records
- Conducting interviews with field staff and actual users
- Researching existing FAQs and other company examples for reference

Remove outdated information and [duplicate content](/en/glossary/Duplicate-Content/ "Identical or very similar content appearing on multiple [web](/en/glossary/Accessibility--Web-/ "Web accessibility is the practice of designing websites so that people with disabilities—such as vision, hearing, or mobility impairments—can use them easily and effectively.") pages, which can confuse search engines and hurt your website's visibility in search results."), organizing only necessary information. Research shows that information "accuracy," "comprehensiveness," and "currency" significantly impact user satisfaction.

### Structuring and Design Points

Structure collected information so users can easily search it:

- Classification by categories and tags
- Search keyword optimization
- Building clear hierarchical structures (e.g., major category → subcategory → detailed articles)

Additionally, utilizing diverse presentation methods such as "question-format titles," "flowcharts," and "diagrams and illustrations" improves intuitive usability. Research confirms that improved hierarchical structure and searchability enhance self-resolution rates.

### Utilizing Templates and Operational Rules

For efficient operation, utilize templates for Q&A and article creation. For example, standardizing items like "Question," "Answer," "Related Links," and "Update Date" enables anyone to register information of consistent quality. Also, incorporate regular information updates and user feedback collection workflows during the design phase.

> Knowledge base creation should follow the sequence: purpose setting → information collection → design and classification → templating → operation. Following this process enables improved [operational efficiency](/en/glossary/Operational-Efficiency/ "Operational Efficiency is how well a company uses its resources like labor and materials to produce products or services at the lowest cost while maintaining quality. It measures a company's ability t") and user satisfaction.

## AI-Enhanced Knowledge Base Management and FAQ Automation

### AI-Powered Automatic Classification and Search Enhancement
[AI ([Artificial Intelligence](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and [make](/en/glossary/Make--[Integromat](/en/glossary/Make--Integromat-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.")-/ "A no-code platform that automates repetitive tasks by visually connecting apps and services without requiring programming knowledge.") decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions."))](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to make human-like judgments and learning. Can automatically find optimal answers") automatically analyzes and classifies large volumes of knowledge base information. Through [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](/en/glossary/natural-language-processing--nlp-/)](/en/glossary/Natural-Language-Processing--NLP-/ "Technology that enables computers to understand and appropriately process human language") technology, even when users search with ambiguous or colloquial expressions, [AI](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and make decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") instantly displays optimal answers and related FAQs.

For example, [generative AI](/en/glossary/Generative-AI/ "Generative AI is [artificial intelligence](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and make decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions.") that creates new content like text, images, and code by learning patterns from data, rather than just analyzing existing information.") extracts "highly relevant Q&As" from inquiry histories and automatically organizes FAQ structures. This mechanism reduces search time and significantly improves self-resolution rates for employees and customers. This effectiveness has been proven in many domestic and international companies.

### Practical Examples of Automatic FAQ Generation and [Chatbot](/en/glossary/Chatbot/ "A program that automatically answers customer questions. Available 24/7 and can respond to simple questions like humans") Integration

AI analyzes past inquiry histories and existing knowledge to automatically generate Q&As. This streamlines regular FAQ updates and new content addition work while maintaining information freshness.

By combining with AI chatbots, optimal answers from the knowledge base can be automatically presented in response to user questions. This [integration](/en/glossary/Integration/ "Integration connects different software and data sources so they work together seamlessly, allowing chatbots and automation tools to share information and operate as one unified system.") has reduced operator [response time](/en/glossary/Response-Time/ "Response time is the total duration between when a user makes a request and when they receive the complete result, serving as a key measure of how fast a system or application performs.") by up to 50% in some cases. AI utilization automates FAQ operations, reducing workload while maintaining high-quality support and customer satisfaction.

## Promoting Knowledge Sharing Through [Workflow](/en/glossary/Workflow/ "Defined business processes and procedures. Rules that determine who does what and when") and [KCS](/en/glossary/Knowledge-Centered-Service--KCS-/ "A system that immediately registers knowledge gained in the field into a database for organization-wide sharing. A knowledge-centered service operation method")

### KCS Fundamentals and Knowledge Sharing Concepts
[KCS (Knowledge-Centered Service)](/en/glossary/Knowledge-Centered-Service--KCS-/ "A system that immediately registers knowledge gained in the field into a database for organization-wide sharing. A knowledge-centered service operation method") is an operational model that immediately reflects field-acquired knowledge into knowledge bases for organization-wide utilization.

KCS emphasizes the concept that "organizations are strengthened through knowledge accumulation and sharing." For example, know-how and troubleshooting methods acquired during work are registered in the knowledge base on the spot. This prevents information silos and enables everyone to utilize new and accurate information.

### Knowledge Integration Flow into Knowledge Base

KCS knowledge base operations involve quickly registering methods and new insights within workflows immediately after inquiry responses or problem resolution. Specifically:

1. After inquiry response, staff input solutions into the knowledge base
2. Input content is reviewed and published organization-wide
3. Content is kept current and accurate through feedback and reuse by other members

Incorporating this procedure into daily operations prevents one-time knowledge use and information fragmentation. This results in improved organizational learning speed.

### KCS Implementation Effects and Field Integration Tips

KCS model implementation has confirmed effects including improved [operational efficiency](/en/glossary/Operational-Efficiency/ "Operational Efficiency is how well a company uses its resources like labor and materials to produce products or services at the lowest cost while maintaining quality. It measures a company's ability t"), faster inquiry response, and reduced training burden. For example, in call centers and support environments, real-time information registration in KCS knowledge bases has achieved standardized and efficient new employee training while improving customer satisfaction.

For successful KCS [integration](/en/glossary/Integration/ "Integration connects different software and data sources so they work together seamlessly, allowing chatbots and automation tools to share information and operate as one unified system.") in the field, adequate staff training, simplified input methods, and continuous content quality management are essential.

Thus, KCS is a modern [knowledge sharing](/en/glossary/Knowledge-Sharing/ "The systematic exchange of information, skills, and experiences between people and teams to improve collective learning and organizational performance.") method that transforms field knowledge into organizational strength.

## Knowledge Base Tool Selection Criteria and Recommended Solutions

### Comparison Points for Knowledge Base Tool Selection

When selecting knowledge base tools, compare and evaluate based on the following six perspectives according to organizational scale and usage purpose:

| Selection Point | Details |
| Searchability | Support for full-text search, tag search, and natural language search |
| Ease of Operation and Updates | Usability of content creation, editing, and management functions |
| Security | Completeness of [access control](/en/glossary/access-control/ "A system that restricts who can use the system and what functions they can access. Security features") and log management |
| Cost Performance | Balance between initial costs, monthly fees, and functionality |
| [Integration](/en/glossary/Integration/ "Integration connects different software and data sources so they work together seamlessly, allowing chatbots and automation tools to share information and operate as one unified system.") with Other Systems | Richness of [API integration](/en/glossary/API-integration/ "A mechanism for different systems to exchange data. Acts as a bridge between systems") and extensibility |
| Support System | Quality of Japanese language support and inquiry response |

For example, AI search and automatic classification features improve self-resolution rates using FAQs.

In Japan, various tools are widely adopted from small to large enterprises. Flexible [note](/en/glossary/note/ "A staff-only message attached to a support [ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a customer support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,") that records actions, decisions, and troubleshooting steps. Notes help team members stay informed and work together efficiently.")-type tools are popular with small businesses, while integrated tools for large-scale environments and development teams, and support-specialized tools offer choices based on usage requirements.

Before implementation, determine priorities for each comparison point while considering usage [scenarios](/en/glossary/scenarios/ "A pre-written conversation blueprint that guides how a chatbot responds to users and performs actions to achieve specific business goals."). This preparation prevents selection failures.

## Realizing Customer Experience and FAQ Integration Through LiveAgent Support Portal

[LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is customer service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently.") [Support Portal](/en/glossary/Support-Portal/ "A website where customers can find answers to common questions, submit support requests, and track their progress all in one place."), also adopted as a core system in SmartWeb's construction services, is a [platform](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") that comprehensively supports corporate customer service.

### LiveAgent Support Portal Key Features and Knowledge Base Integration

[LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is customer service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and [social media](/en/glossary/platform/ "Explore social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.") into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently.") [Support Portal](/en/glossary/Support-Portal/ "A website where customers can find answers to common questions, submit support requests, and track their progress all in one place.") can integrate and handle multiple communication channels including [ticket management](/en/glossary/[ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a [customer support ticket](/en/glossary/ticket/ "Learn what a customer support ticket is, how ticketing systems work,") is, how ticketing systems work,")-management/ "A system that manages customer inquiries as numbered cases and tracks response status"), [live chat](/en/glossary/Live-Chat/ "Live chat is a real-time messaging tool that lets customers instantly connect with support staff or chatbots directly on websites or apps for immediate help."), social media, and email. This enables centralized management of customer inquiries. Combined with FAQs and knowledge bases, it promotes customer [self-service](/en/glossary/self-service/ "Services that help customers solve problems independently. Provides FAQs and operation guides") problem resolution.

For example, users can search "[frequently asked questions](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.")" or "troubleshooting guides" on the portal to immediately find solutions. This reduces inquiry volume and improves response speed.

[LiveAgent](/en/glossary/LiveAgent/ "LiveAgent is customer service software that brings all customer messages from email, chat, phone, and social media into one place, helping support teams respond faster and more efficiently.") includes AI chatbots and automatic response features, enabling automatic responses based on FAQ content. It also analyzes inquiry histories in real-time and displays information optimized for each user. This prevents dependence on specific staff and response delays.

Furthermore, feedback functions and access data analysis enable efficient review of popular FAQ content and addition of new content.

### Implementation Cases and Operational Improvement Points

Companies that implemented LiveAgent [Support Portal](/en/glossary/Support-Portal/ "A website where customers can find answers to common questions, submit support requests, and track their progress all in one place.") have achieved effects including "immediate FAQ updates," "automatic customer feedback collection," and "improved self-resolution rates." For example, one IT service company achieved FAQ access accounting for approximately 60% of all inquiries through LiveAgent utilization, resulting in 30% support cost reduction.

Operationally, establishing regular FAQ update mechanisms, [UI](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---UI-/ "Explore [User Interfaces](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---UI-/ "Explore User Interfaces (UI): definition, types (GUI, CLI, VUI, Touch),") (UI): definition, types (GUI, CLI, VUI, Touch),") improvements through customer search behavior analysis, and AI-powered frequent keyword extraction are effective.

## Knowledge Base Operation Trends and Success Tips for 2025 and Beyond

### Deepening Data Utilization and [Personalization](/en/glossary/Personalization/ "Providing optimal information and services tailored to each individual's preferences and situation")

Future knowledge base operations will center on advanced data utilization using AI and [data science](/en/glossary/data-science/ "Technology that analyzes large amounts of data to discover useful information and trends"). AI can analyze FAQ and knowledge base access logs and user attributes to automatically display information optimized for individual users (personalized FAQs).

With the spread of this mechanism, users can more easily and quickly discover individually optimized solutions, improving self-resolution rates. Indeed, domestic and international surveys report approximately 20-30% reduction in inquiries and improved customer satisfaction ([CSAT](/en/glossary/Customer-Satisfaction---CSAT-/ "A metric that measures how satisfied customers are with a product or service by asking them to rate their experience, helping companies identify areas for improvement.")) at companies implementing FAQ systems with personalization features.

### Self-Service Orientation and [UX](/en/glossary/User-Experience--UX-/ "User experience and satisfaction when using systems") Optimization

Self-service portals with intuitive operation are essential for [organizational knowledge](/en/glossary/Organizational-Knowledge/ "The collective skills, experiences, and information that employees share within a company, used to help the organization work efficiently and make better decisions.") base operations. 2025 trends include mobile compatibility, improved search accuracy, and introduction of user-friendly [user interfaces ([UI](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---UI-/ "Explore [User Interfaces](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---UI-/ "Explore User Interfaces (UI): definition, types (GUI, CLI, VUI, Touch),") (UI): definition, types (GUI, CLI, VUI, Touch),"))](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---[UI](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---UI-/ "Explore [User Interfaces](/en/glossary/user-interfaces---UI-/ "Explore User Interfaces (UI): definition, types (GUI, CLI, VUI, Touch),") (UI): definition, types (GUI, CLI, VUI, Touch),")-/ "The screens and operation methods users interact with in systems. Directly impacts usability").

For example, AI-powered natural language search and automatic question suggestion features are becoming standardized. These improvements reduce traditional issues like "can't find information even when searching" and "difficult to use," promoting self-resolution for diverse users.

### Success Tips: Start Small and Continuously Improve

To succeed in knowledge base operations, first analyze usage data from existing FAQs and knowledge bases. Visualize which information is frequently accessed and where users are dropping off.

Then, utilize AI automatic analysis and feedback functions to regularly review content and structure from the user perspective. Additionally, rather than implementing all measures like personalization and UI improvements at once, it's effective to start partially, confirm results, and gradually expand.

> Knowledge base operations from 2025 onward will evolve with "AI-powered individual optimization" and "[user experience](/en/glossary/User-Experience--UX-/ "User Experience (UX) is the overall experience someone has when using a product or service. It focuses on making digital products easy to use and enjoyable by understanding what users need and want.") focus." By leveraging analytical data and starting with small improvements for continuous review, operational efficiency and satisfaction improvements can be achieved.

Knowledge bases, when properly constructed and operated, are high-[ROI](/en/glossary/ROI/ "ROI measures how much profit or value you gain from an investment compared to what you spent. It helps businesses decide whether investing in new tools like AI chatbots will actually save money or boo") systems that can deliver significant benefits even for small and medium enterprises. We recommend starting small and gradually expanding functionality.
