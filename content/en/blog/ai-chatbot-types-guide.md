## What is an AI Chatbot?

### Definition of AI Chatbot

An AI chatbot is software built using [artificial intelligence](/en/glossary/artificial-intelligence/ "Technology that enables computers to learn from experience and make decisions like humans do, rather than just following preset instructions."). This program can converse in natural language just like humans. It can interact through text or voice on websites, apps, LINE, and other SNS platforms.

Modern AI chatbots combine technologies such as [large language models](/en/glossary/large-language-models/ "Explore Large Language Models ([LLMs](/en/glossary/large-language-models/ "Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language, powering applications like chatbots, translation, and content creation.")), advanced AI systems leveraging [deep learning](/en/glossary/deep-learning/ "Deep learning is an advanced AI branch using multi-layered neural networks to learn complex patterns from data. Essential for image recognition, NLP, and generative AI.") and [transformer](/en/glossary/Transformer/ "Comprehensive guide to Transformer architecture in deep learning - attention mechanisms, neural networks, and natural language processing applications.") networks for [text generation](/en/glossary/Text-Generation/ "Comprehensive guide to text generation: AI-powered content creation, natural language processing, and automated writing technologies for modern applications."), translation, and more. Understand their core concepts, applications, and challenges."), [deep learning](/en/glossary/deep-learning/ "Deep learning is an advanced AI branch using multi-layered neural networks to learn complex patterns from data. Essential for image recognition, NLP, and generative AI."), and [natural language processing](/en/glossary/natural-language-processing--nlp-/). This allows them to automatically generate human-like responses to customer questions.

### Basic Mechanisms

Traditional chatbots responded based on predetermined rules or [scenarios](/en/glossary/scenarios/ "Explore scenarios (chatbot scripts) in AI chatbot and automation systems. Learn their definition, structure (blocks, events, actions), creation process, and benefits for businesses."). Modern AI chatbots learn patterns and context from large amounts of text data. Therefore, they can flexibly handle questions they've never encountered before.

For example, in [customer support](/en/glossary/customer-support/ "Explore customer support operations, its importance, types, channels, and the role of AI and automation. Learn best practices, team structures, and key metrics for effective customer support."), [FAQs](/en/glossary/[FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.")/ "Explore [FAQ](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.") ([Frequently Asked Questions](/en/glossary/FAQ/ "A curated list of common questions and answers about a topic, product, or service. FAQs help users find information quickly and reduce repetitive support requests.")) as a foundational pillar of digital communication, customer support, and AI chatbots. Learn its definition, purpose, benefits, and implementation."), and automated guidance, they can accurately understand what customers need and provide relevant information and suggestions.

- Automated form responses

Hybrid and generative AI types can be equipped with many functions such as business support and automated form responses.

### Selecting Performance and Functionality

When choosing an AI chatbot, compare both "performance" (how accurately it can respond) and "functionality" (what business operations it can handle). Selecting a type that matches your objectives and use cases enables more effective utilization.

## Learning Method Differences

Understanding how AI chatbots become smarter helps in selecting the appropriate system. Let's look at the main learning methods.

### Supervised Learning

In [supervised learning](/en/glossary/supervised-learning/ "Supervised learning is a foundational machine learning paradigm where algorithms learn from labeled data to map inputs to desired outputs, making accurate predictions on new, unseen data."), the AI chatbot is given data with correct answers provided by humans to learn proper response methods.

**Example:**  
Prepare many examples like "I want to cancel my order" → "I'll guide you through the cancellation process". The AI uses these examples to statistically derive appropriate responses.

**Characteristics:**
- Can answer with high accuracy
- Requires preparation of quality data
- Regular updates are essential

### Unsupervised Learning

In [unsupervised learning](/en/glossary/unsupervised-learning/ "Comprehensive glossary on unsupervised learning, covering definitions,"), without providing correct answers, AI finds patterns and features on its own from large amounts of conversation data.

**Characteristics:**
- Flexibly handles unknown questions
- Data preparation is relatively simple
- Output quality can be unstable

### Reinforcement Learning

In [reinforcement learning](/en/glossary/reinforcement-learning/ "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment and maximizing cumulative rewards through trial and error."), the AI chatbot receives evaluations based on conversation results while repeating trial and error.

Correct responses receive "rewards" while incorrect responses receive "penalties". This way, AI continues to learn to provide better responses.

### Continuous Learning/Online Learning

In [continuous learning](/en/glossary/continuous-learning/ "An AI system that learns and improves continuously from new data without forgetting previous knowledge, adapting to changing conditions like humans do over time."), the AI chatbot updates knowledge in real-time to adapt to new questions and changes in business content. This allows flexible response to changing situations and new information even after implementation.

> **Key Point:** Each AI chatbot learning method has its own characteristics. Selecting learning methods based on objectives and operational methods enables more practical and accurate chatbot operation.

## Use Case-Based Chatbot Selection

### Optimal Selection Based on Business Content and Objectives

When choosing an AI chatbot, thoroughly confirm the implementation objectives and actual business content. The suitable chatbot type varies by industry and use case.
