You are given a glossary article with optional metadata input. Your task is to generate ONLY the Hugo frontmatter metadata.

---

## INPUT FORMAT

You may receive metadata in this format (optional):
```
Category: [category name]
Keyword: [keyword name]
Description: [specific description for this keyword context]
```

**Important about Description input:**
- If Description is provided in input, it means this keyword may have multiple meanings in different contexts
- Use the provided Description to clarify which specific meaning this article covers
- This Description should ONLY appear in the frontmatter, NOT in the article body

---

## YOUR TASK

Generate ONLY the frontmatter section. DO NOT modify or include the input metadata in the article body.

---

## FRONTMATTER FORMAT

```
---
title: "[Keyword from input OR first H1 heading]"
date: [Current date YYYY-MM-DD]
translationKey: "[lowercase-hyphen-separated version of title]"
description: "[Description from input OR SEO optimized description, max 160 characters]"
keywords: ["[keyword1]", "[keyword2]", "[keyword3]", "[keyword4]", "[keyword5]"]
category: "[Category from input OR extracted from article OR 'General']"
type: "glossary"
draft: true
---
```

---

## FIELD GENERATION RULES

### title
- **Priority 1:** Use Keyword from input if provided
- **Priority 2:** Extract from first H1 heading (skip "Writing style definition" if present)
- **Format:** Keep as-is, wrap in quotes
- **Example:** `title: "Active Learning"`

### date
- Use current date (2025-11-25)
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- NO quotes
- **Example:** `date: 2025-11-25`

### translationKey
- Convert title to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters: ( ) / \ : ; , . " '
- **Examples:**
  - "Active Learning" → `translationKey: "active-learning"`
  - "Code Block (Python/JS)" → `translationKey: "code-block-python-js"`

### description
- **Priority 1:** Use Description from input if provided (this clarifies the specific context/meaning)
- **Priority 2:** Extract or create SEO-optimized description from article
- **Maximum length:** 160 characters
- **Wrap in quotes**
- **Example:** `description: "A machine learning process where the model explicitly asks a human to label data points it is uncertain about."`

**Note on Description input:**
When Description is provided in input, it serves to disambiguate the keyword. For example:
- Keyword: "Active Learning" 
- Description: "A machine learning process..." (distinguishes from educational pedagogy meaning)

### keywords
- Extract top 5 most relevant keywords from article
- Include the main Keyword as first item
- Array format with quotes
- **Example:** `keywords: ["Active Learning", "Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning", "Data Annotation", "Human-in-the-Loop"]`

### category
- **Priority 1:** Use Category from input if provided
- **Priority 2:** Extract from "Category:" field in article
- **Priority 3:** Use "General" as default
- **Example:** `category: "AI Chatbot & Automation"`

### type
- Always: `type: "glossary"`

### draft
- Always: `draft: true` (boolean, NO quotes)

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Output ONLY the frontmatter section**
2. **Start with ---**
3. **End with ---**
4. **DO NOT use ```yaml annotation**
5. **DO NOT include input metadata (Category, Keyword, Description) in article body**
6. **Input metadata is ONLY for frontmatter generation**
7. **DO NOT modify the article content**

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: With Input Metadata

**Input Metadata:**
```
Category: AI Chatbot & Automation
Keyword: Active Learning
Description: A machine learning process where the model explicitly asks a human to label data points it is uncertain about.
```

**Article:**
```
# Active Learning

## What is Active Learning?

Active Learning is a supervised machine learning paradigm...

```

**Output (ONLY frontmatter):**
```
---
title: "Active Learning"
date: 2025-11-25
translationKey: "active-learning"
description: "A machine learning process where the model explicitly asks a human to label data points it is uncertain about."
keywords: ["Active Learning", "Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning", "Data Annotation", "Query Strategy"]
category: "AI Chatbot & Automation"
type: "glossary"
draft: true
---
```

**Important:** The input metadata (Category, Keyword, Description) should NOT appear in the article body.

### Example 2: Without Input Metadata

**Article:**
```
# Neural Networks

## Introduction

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks...

Category: Deep Learning

[rest of article]
```

**Output (ONLY frontmatter):**
```
---
title: "Neural Networks"
date: 2025-11-25
translationKey: "neural-networks"
description: "Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that learn from data to make predictions and decisions."
keywords: ["Neural Networks", "Deep Learning", "Machine Learning", "Artificial Intelligence", "Backpropagation"]
category: "Deep Learning"
type: "glossary"
draft: true
---
```

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ DO NOT output:
```yaml
---
title: "Active Learning"
...
---
```

❌ DO NOT include input metadata in article:
```
# Active Learning

Category: AI Chatbot & Automation
Keyword: Active Learning
Description: A machine learning process...

## What is Active Learning?
...
```

✅ CORRECT:
```
---
title: "Active Learning"
date: 2025-11-25
...
---
```

And the article body remains unchanged (no input metadata added).
