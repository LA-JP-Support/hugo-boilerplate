## Definition and Role of Knowledge Base

A Knowledge Base is a collection of organized information that includes business knowledge, know-how, work procedures, troubleshooting examples, and success stories used within companies and organizations. It serves as an information infrastructure that allows anyone to quickly look up necessary information when needed.

Knowledge bases manage both tacit knowledge (knowledge gained from experience and explicit knowledge (knowledge documented in manuals and other materials in a database format. They are designed to provide efficient access to information using mechanisms such as AI search functionality, tagging, and hierarchical structures.

For example, they are useful in standardizing work procedures, preventing knowledge from being concentrated in specific individuals, and facilitating smooth onboarding of new employees.

## Differences Between FAQ and Knowledge Base
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions is content that compiles common questions from users or employees along with their answers. FAQ is positioned as part of a knowledge base.

While FAQ follows a simple format of paired "questions" and "answers," knowledge bases organize a broader range of information including detailed operation guides, business workflows, error response methods, and video explanations. FAQ is designed for quickly finding answers to specific questions, while knowledge bases also accommodate users who want to explore various information independently.

## Background and Value of Knowledge Base Utilization in 2025

In 2025, knowledge bases have incorporated AI-powered automatic classification and natural language search capabilities, with continued expansion of remote work and efforts to improve customer experience (CX. In this context, knowledge bases are treated as core assets for enhancing corporate competitiveness.

Research shows that approximately 70% of companies that implemented knowledge bases experienced "faster inquiry response," "improved operational efficiency," and "enhanced employee satisfaction and retention rates." For example, companies that established internal knowledge bases reduced new employee training periods by up to 30%, while those that enhanced customer-facing FAQs reduced support costs by 20%.

These results demonstrate that properly constructed knowledge bases can significantly improve overall company productivity, satisfaction, and customer experience quality.

## Practical Steps for Creating a Knowledge Base

This chapter provides step-by-step learning of basic knowledge base (FAQ creation methods and key points for design and structuring.

### Clarifying Purpose and Target Audience

When creating a knowledge base, first clarify "what it's for" and "who will use it." For example, internal purposes might include supporting new employees or reducing inquiries, while customer-facing purposes might focus on improving self-resolution rates. The necessary information and presentation methods vary depending on the purpose. Design with specific consideration of target users' skill levels and usage scenarios.

### Information Collection and Organization

Next, collect information to be included in the knowledge base. Main collection methods include:

- Investigating internal documents, manuals, and past inquiry records
- Conducting interviews with field staff and actual users
- Researching existing FAQs and other company examples for reference

Remove outdated information and duplicate content, organizing only necessary information. Research shows that information "accuracy," "comprehensiveness," and "currency" significantly impact user satisfaction.

### Structuring and Design Points

Structure collected information so users can easily search it:

- Classification by categories and tags
- Search keyword optimization
- Building clear hierarchical structures (e.g., major category → subcategory → detailed articles

Additionally, utilizing diverse presentation methods such as "question-format titles," "flowcharts," and "diagrams and illustrations" improves intuitive usability. Research confirms that improved hierarchical structure and searchability enhance self-resolution rates.

### Utilizing Templates and Operational Rules

For efficient operation, utilize templates for Q&A and article creation. For example, standardizing items like "Question," "Answer," "Related Links," and "Update Date" enables anyone to register information of consistent quality. Also, incorporate regular information updates and user feedback collection workflows during the design phase.

> Knowledge base creation should follow the sequence: purpose setting → information collection → design and classification → templating → operation. Following this process enables improved operational efficiency and user satisfaction.

## AI-Enhanced Knowledge Base Management and FAQ Automation

### AI-Powered Automatic Classification and Search Enhancement
AI (Artificial Intelligence automatically analyzes and classifies large volumes of knowledge base information. Through Natural Language Processing (NLP technology, even when users search with ambiguous or colloquial expressions, AI instantly displays optimal answers and related FAQs.

For example, generative AI extracts "highly relevant Q&As" from inquiry histories and automatically organizes FAQ structures. This mechanism reduces search time and significantly improves self-resolution rates for employees and customers. This effectiveness has been proven in many domestic and international companies.

### Practical Examples of Automatic FAQ Generation and Chatbot Integration

AI analyzes past inquiry histories and existing knowledge to automatically generate Q&As. This streamlines regular FAQ updates and new content addition work while maintaining information freshness.

By combining with AI chatbots, optimal answers from the knowledge base can be automatically presented in response to user questions. This integration has reduced operator response time by up to 50% in some cases. AI utilization automates FAQ operations, reducing workload while maintaining high-quality support and customer satisfaction.

## Promoting Knowledge Sharing Through Workflow and KCS

### KCS Fundamentals and Knowledge Sharing Concepts
KCS (Knowledge-Centered Service is an operational model that immediately reflects field-acquired knowledge into knowledge bases for organization-wide utilization.

KCS emphasizes the concept that "organizations are strengthened through knowledge accumulation and sharing." For example, know-how and troubleshooting methods acquired during work are registered in the knowledge base on the spot. This prevents information silos and enables everyone to utilize new and accurate information.

### Knowledge Integration Flow into Knowledge Base

KCS knowledge base operations involve quickly registering methods and new insights within workflows immediately after inquiry responses or problem resolution. Specifically:

1. After inquiry response, staff input solutions into the knowledge base
2. Input content is reviewed and published organization-wide
3. Content is kept current and accurate through feedback and reuse by other members

Incorporating this procedure into daily operations prevents one-time knowledge use and information fragmentation. This results in improved organizational learning speed.

### KCS Implementation Effects and Field Integration Tips

KCS model implementation has confirmed effects including improved operational efficiency, faster inquiry response, and reduced training burden. For example, in call centers and support environments, real-time information registration in KCS knowledge bases has achieved standardized and efficient new employee training while improving customer satisfaction.

For successful KCS integration in the field, adequate staff training, simplified input methods, and continuous content quality management are essential.

Thus, KCS is a modern knowledge sharing method that transforms field knowledge into organizational strength.

## Knowledge Base Tool Selection Criteria and Recommended Solutions

### Comparison Points for Knowledge Base Tool Selection

When selecting knowledge base tools, compare and evaluate based on the following six perspectives according to organizational scale and usage purpose:

| Selection Point | Details |
| Searchability | Support for full-text search, tag search, and natural language search |
| Ease of Operation and Updates | Usability of content creation, editing, and management functions |
| Security | Completeness of access control and log management |
| Cost Performance | Balance between initial costs, monthly fees, and functionality |
