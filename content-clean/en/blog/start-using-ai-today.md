In recent years, AI implementation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs has gained attention as a realistic option for achieving operational efficiency and digital transformation.

Many SMEs face challenges such as "not knowing who handled what" and "missing responses" that arise from individually managing diverse inquiry channels—email, phone, SNS, and chat. The key to fundamentally resolving this confusion lies in implementing AI chatbots, AI email auto-response generation, and ticket systems.

SmartWeb provides services combining the LiveAgent ticket system used by over 40,000 companies worldwide with the " FlowHunt" automation platform utilizing the latest AI technology. AI handles customer support 24/7 automatically, creating response drafts for emails and inquiry forms. Staff simply review, modify, and send—eliminating the need to compose messages from scratch.

Additionally, AI learns from daily response data and grows smarter with use. Supporting approximately 100 languages including Japanese, English, and Chinese, it facilitates support for international customers.

Even if you think "It seems difficult without IT staff," rest assured. SmartWeb requires no specialized knowledge, with Japanese staff providing thorough support from implementation through operations.

Thus, AI implementation for SMEs has become a powerful means of simultaneously advancing customer service quality, operational efficiency, and digital transformation.

By implementing " ticket systems," "AI email auto-response generation," and "AI chatbots," SMEs can achieve high-quality customer support previously available only to large enterprises. SmartWeb is chosen by many SMEs as an all-in-one service that even IT beginners can use with confidence.

### Ticket System: Centralized Inquiry Management

A ticket system is a mechanism that can centrally manage inquiries arriving from diverse channels—email, phone, SNS, chat, inquiry forms.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Multi-channel Centralization**: Manage inquiries from all channels on a single screen, eliminating response gaps
- **Information Sharing and Quality Improvement**: Immediately access past interactions, enabling smooth handoffs when staff changes
- **Automatic Recording and AI Utilization**: All interactions are automatically recorded and utilized as AI learning data
- **Flexible Work from Anywhere**: Being cloud-based, responses are possible from remote work locations, on the go, or via smartphone
- ** Business Automation**: Significantly reduce response time through automatic replies with standard templates for common questions and automatic assignment to staff

### AI Email Auto-Response Generation: Dramatically Reduce Staff Burden

AI email auto-response generation is a feature where AI automatically creates response drafts for questions from emails, inquiry forms, and SNS, presenting them to staff. Employees no longer need to compose messages from scratch, significantly reducing work time.

**AI Email Auto-Response Generation Process:**

**❶ Receive Email or Inquiry Form**
Following automation rules configured in LiveAgent, AI retrieves the full email text. At this stage, spam filtering automatically executes for not only general spam but also sales emails. Since response drafts aren't created for unnecessary emails, staff's wasted work is reduced.

**❷ AI Understands Questions and Creates Response Drafts**
For legitimate inquiries that pass spam filtering, AI understands the content and creates optimal response drafts based on pre-learned knowledge bases and internal documents.

**❸ Display Response Draft as Memo on Operation Screen**
AI presents the response draft as a note on the LiveAgent operation screen. Staff review the content and modify as necessary.

**❹ Further Improve Responses with AI Answer Assistant**
If needed, use the AI answer assistant to refine text or add explanations for technical terms before replying.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Automated Spam Filtering**: Automatically identifies not only general spam but also sales emails, preventing unnecessary response draft creation
- **Significantly Reduced Work Time**: No need to compose from scratch—reply with just review and modification
- **Standardized Response Quality**: AI presents consistent quality response drafts, reducing variations in staff responses
- **Multilingual Support**: AI trained in Japanese supports approximately 100 languages, enabling immediate response to international customers
- ** Continuous Learning**: AI learns from daily response data, improving answer accuracy

### AI Chatbot: 24/7 Automated Response

An AI chatbot is a system where AI handles customer support automatically 24/7. It responds immediately even outside business hours, late at night, or on holidays, significantly improving customer satisfaction.

**Key Benefits:**

- **24/7 Automated Response**: AI operates constantly, responding immediately even outside business hours
- **Complete Integration with Ticket System**: AI chat interactions are automatically recorded, with smooth handoff to human staff with one click for complex questions
- **Seamless Customer Experience**: Customers receive high-quality support without being aware of differences between AI and humans
