## Overview of Chat Distribution
Chat distribution is a system that automatically assigns incoming chats to appropriate agents. It distributes chats based on conditions such as queues, skills, workload, and history to minimize response delays and quality variations.

### Effective Distribution Strategy
Even during busy support periods, assignments are made based on rules to prevent bias and missed opportunities. Handoffs from first-line support to specialized departments become smoother, reducing lead time to resolution.
