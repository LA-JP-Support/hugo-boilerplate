## Chat Queue Overview

### How Chat Waiting Works

When all online agents are busy and there are no available slots, a queue waiting message is displayed.

When a slot becomes available, the call is automatically routed to an agent.

※The above example shows that the waiting position is 1st in the queue.

### Actions Users Can Take

- Users can enter and send their questions while waiting. (The question content will be delivered as soon as the agent responds)
- Users can also stop waiting and leave an offline message. (Requires "Chat Window" setting configuration)

## Offline Message Feature
