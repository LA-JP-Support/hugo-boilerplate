## LiveAgent Live Chat Simultaneous Response Handling

### Basic Settings for Simultaneous Response

In LiveAgent's live chat, **the number of people that can be handled simultaneously can be set for each operator**. There is a system that allows you to adjust the "maximum number of simultaneous responses" according to experience and skills, enabling efficient responses within a reasonable range.

### Typical Number of Simultaneous Responses

Generally, **handling about 3-5 cases per person simultaneously** is common, but it's also possible to increase or decrease this number as needed.

### Queue (Waiting) System

When all operators are busy, new customers are automatically placed in a queue and will be connected as soon as an operator becomes available.
