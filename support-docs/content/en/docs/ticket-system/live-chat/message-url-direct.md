## URL Clicking Issues

When clicking URLs within chat messages, they often don't function as expected. This is a common challenge caused by limitations in how many chat platforms recognize URLs.

### URL Recognition Limitations

When characters or symbols follow before or after a URL, the system cannot automatically recognize it as a link. For example, in messages like "Details are available at https://example.com/page," the URL may not become clickable. This limitation requires users to manually copy and paste the URL.

### How to Display Clickable URLs

To click URLs and jump directly to the destination, there are two main effective methods:

#### Sending URLs Independently
Sending URLs completely independently is the most reliable way to create links. Examples:
- https://smartweb.example.com
- https://support.smartweb.jp/docs

#### Using Spaces Method
By inserting spaces between characters or symbols before and after the URL, the system can more easily recognize the URL. Examples:
- Here is the details page https://example.com/page for reference
- Reference link https://support.smartweb.jp/guide please check

#### Notes and Recommendations
- Always start URLs with "http://" or "https://"
- Use short and clear URLs whenever possible
- Consider using URL shortening services for long URLs
