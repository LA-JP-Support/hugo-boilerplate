## LiveAgent Live Chat: Efficient Customer Support

### Benefits and Features of Live Chat

LiveAgent's live chat feature not only waits for customer inquiries but also allows agents to send requests to customers. Live chat is an excellent support channel that enables customers to make inquiries faster than email and more casually than phone calls, facilitating smooth problem resolution.

### Efficient Chat Response

One of the key features of live chat is that a single agent can handle up to 10 chats simultaneously. Even with a small support staff, you can serve many customers without making them wait in long queues. Utilize "frequently used phrases" to reduce keystrokes and provide smooth and efficient support responses to customers.

### Multimedia-Capable Chat Support

During customer interactions, both text chat and file transfers between customers and agents are possible. No problem if file sharing such as catalogs or quotes is requested during chat support. Files up to 128 MB can be transferred regardless of file extension. Additionally, you can specify which file extensions are allowed for transfer, enabling operations such as allowing only document files to be sent and received.

### Proactive Customer Support

On web pages where LiveAgent chat buttons are installed, customers visiting the page are displayed in a list within the LiveAgent agent screen along with referrer information and time spent on the page. You can send "invitation chat" requests to customers who have been on the page for a long time, enabling proactive approaches to customers who are having difficulties on the web.
