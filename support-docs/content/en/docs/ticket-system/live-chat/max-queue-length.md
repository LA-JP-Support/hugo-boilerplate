## Overview of Max Queue Length

Max queue length sets the upper limit for the number of chats that can wait simultaneously, preventing excessive congestion. When the limit is reached, customers are guided to alternative channels (forms or callback contacts) to maintain quality without compromising customer experience.

By adjusting the appropriate upper limit based on operational performance, you can reduce response delays and SLA violations while avoiding agent burnout.

### Key Objectives of Max Queue Length

**Key Points:**

- Control congestion by setting waiting limits
- Automatically guide to alternative channels when limits are exceeded
- Reduce risk of response delays and SLA violations
- Prevent agent overload and turnover
- Flexibly optimize limit values according to demand

### Queue Management Strategies

#### Congestion Control
By setting upper limits for queues, you maintain customer service quality and prevent excessive burden on agents.

#### Utilizing Alternative Channels
When limits are reached, guide customers to alternative contact methods (forms or callback contacts) to optimize customer experience.

### Flexible Operational Optimization

#### Continuous Adjustment
Achieve efficient customer support by analyzing operational performance and regularly reviewing queue upper limits.

#### Performance Improvement
Through proper queue management, achieve reduced response delays, SLA compliance, and reduced agent burden.
