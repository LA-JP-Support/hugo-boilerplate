## Basic Concepts of Chat Button Animations

### Purpose and Effects of Animations
Add animation effects to buttons to naturally attract visitors' attention. By incorporating movements such as blinking, sliding, or pulsing, you can aim to improve click rates compared to static buttons.

### Design Considerations for Animations
Overly flashy effects can become a reason for visitors to leave, so it's effective to start testing with subtle movements that match the brand's tone. Set trigger conditions based on page dwell time or scroll amount to guide users at the appropriate timing.

## Key Points of Chat Button Animations

### Click Rate Improvement Strategy
- Enhance visibility to boost chat initiation rates
- Use trigger conditions (dwell time, scroll amount, etc.) for targeted display
- Adjust animation intensity to match brand tone

### Device Optimization
- Optimize for both mobile and desktop devices

### Performance Verification
- A/B testing available to verify the effectiveness of animations
