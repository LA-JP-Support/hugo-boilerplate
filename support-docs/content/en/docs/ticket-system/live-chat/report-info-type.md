## About Chat-Related Information Types

### Definition of Chat Incoming and Chat

Performance reports, team reports, channel reports, and tag reports can aggregate items (information types) including "Chat Incoming" and "Chat".

### Details of Chat Incoming

"Chat Incoming" refers to the number of chats initiated when website visitors click the chat button. This also counts calls that were disconnected because agents could not respond.

### Details of Chat

"Chat" refers to the total number of all chats that were started.

#### How Chats are Counted

Additionally, when other agents join an ongoing chat session, they are counted separately.

### Chat Invitation Patterns

#### Automatic Invitations

LiveAgent can automatically initiate invitations (based on invitation chat pre-settings).

When website visitors accept the invitation, it is counted as a "Chat".

#### Agent-Initiated Invitations

Agents can also initiate invitations from the agent panel, and these are also counted as "Chat".

### Counting Example

When a website visitor clicks the chat button to start a chat and 2 agents simultaneously join, it counts as 1 "Chat Incoming" and 2 "Chats".
