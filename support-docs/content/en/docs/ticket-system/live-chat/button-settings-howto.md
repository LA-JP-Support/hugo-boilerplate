## What is a Chat Button

Chat buttons enable real-time conversations between visitors on your website and agents. Chats are also converted to tickets just like other communications and are promptly connected to agents on the configured team.

*Live chat functionality is available on "Professional" or "Advanced" plans.

Additionally, chat buttons allow free configuration of the following:

- Team assignment for each button
- Button design and text
- Chat window design
- Presence/absence of offline button, etc.

Beyond the above, it's also possible to use and configure pre-chat forms where visitors can input their information and question details before starting a chat.

## How to Configure Chat Button

### Chat Button Design Settings

From the agent screen left menu, select "Settings" > "Chat" > "Chat Button" and choose your preferred chat button design. Different types of buttons can be selected depending on where the chat button is displayed. It's also possible to freely edit HTML as a "Custom Button" or register original images.

### Online Button Editing

Online buttons are displayed when assigned agents are online and available for chat support.

- Set the button display position.
- Edit button text. Determine the character count according to the size.
- Change color sets.

### Chat Window Settings

Customize the chat window displayed on the site visitor's side. Specify title, welcome message, screen design, display position, colors, etc.

### Pre-chat Form Settings

Pre-chat forms are a feature for obtaining information about visitors and their requirements before starting live chat. This can also be used for members-only support requiring contract number input.

- To use, check the option on the "Overview" page.
- Similar settings to contact forms can be configured.
- When users input required items and click "Chat", the chat window opens.

### Offline Button Settings

When assigned agents are absent, you can specify the display of a button that notifies of absence (offline). This is called an "Offline Button". When offline button is enabled, clicking the button during offline hours switches to a contact form.

- To use, check the option on the "Overview" page.
- If not used, the button itself won't be displayed.
- Offline button messages can also be edited.

### Offline Contact Form Settings

When using offline buttons, it's necessary to configure the contact form displayed during offline hours. Similar settings to contact forms can be configured.

### Overview Settings

- Change the display name within the settings screen
- Set the assigned team
- Set language (when supporting multiple languages)
- Select pre-form usage
- Select offline button usage
- Chat buttons are activated by turning on the "Active" checkbox
- When chat buttons are implemented, statistics (views, accepts, click rate) will be displayed on this page

### Website Integration

Displaying "Integration" shows the html code for integrating with the website where you want to place the chat button.

- Paste the displayed code as-is to the website page where you want to display the contact button or contact page form. Place the code before the </body> tag of the page you're using.
- Buttons and pages cannot be displayed in local files, so please make sure to upload to a web server.
