## Using Phone Numbers with LiveAgent

### Basics of SIP Trunk and Number Integration

Using your current phone number with LiveAgent is only possible if that number supports SIP trunk. LiveAgent's call center functionality operates by connecting numbers from VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) providers that support SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) trunks.

### Important Limitations

- LiveAgent does not provide or sell phone numbers
- Regular phone numbers that do not support SIP trunk cannot be integrated
- You need to purchase a number from a VoIP provider and obtain SIP connection information

### Information Required for SIP Connection

If your current number is from a VoIP provider and supports SIP trunk, you can obtain the following information from that provider and configure it in LiveAgent:

- Phone number
- SIP host (URL or IP address)
- SIP port
- Username
- Password

## Cloud Migration of Fixed Phone Numbers in Japan

### 0ABJ Number Porting via Twilio

From January 31, 2025, through partnership with SoftBank, fixed phone numbers throughout Japan (so-called "0ABJ numbers" such as 03, 06, etc.) can now be used directly on Twilio. Without adding communication equipment, they are cloud-enabled and can be integrated with Twilio's AI agents and other services.

### Additional Information

Twilio's blog also introduces how existing fixed phone numbers can be migrated to the cloud while keeping the same number.
