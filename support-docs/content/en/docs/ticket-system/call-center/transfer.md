## Overview of Transfer Functionality

Call transfer is an important feature that enables seamless transfer of ongoing calls to other agents or departments.

### Types of Transfer Methods

You can choose between "warm transfer (with prior explanation)" or "blind transfer (immediate transfer)" as needed.

For example, when a customer's inquiry involves a specialized field, an agent can briefly explain the situation before handing it over to the appropriate person. This eliminates the need for customers to wastefully repeat the same explanation.

## Benefits of Transfer Functionality

Smooth transfer functionality is the key to achieving consistent responses across the entire team.

### Main Advantages

- Easy handover of calls to other representatives
- Support for both warm and blind transfers
- Reduces the burden on customers to repeat explanations
- Strengthens collaborative framework between departments
- Improves overall support efficiency
