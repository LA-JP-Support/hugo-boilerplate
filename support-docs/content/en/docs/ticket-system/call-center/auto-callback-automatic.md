## Overview of Automatic Callback

Automatic Callback is a feature that eliminates the need for customers to wait continuously during busy periods and automatically calls them back when their turn comes. It reduces long hold times and frustration while providing a smooth customer experience.

## Benefits of Automatic Callback

Many call centers have customers waiting anywhere from several minutes to tens of minutes. By implementing automatic callback, customers are freed from the "stress of continuous waiting" and can receive responses at the appropriate timing.

### Optimized Corporate Resources
Companies can also reduce call costs during waiting periods and utilize resources efficiently. For agents, being able to resume calls without strain leads to stabilized response quality. As a result, customer satisfaction improves and brand trustworthiness increases.

## Key Points of Automatic Callback

- Reduce customer waiting time and minimize dissatisfaction
- Automatically manage callback order to prevent missed responses
- Optimize call costs and improve operational efficiency
- Balance agent workload
- Overall improvement in customer experience quality
