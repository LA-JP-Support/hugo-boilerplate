## What is Call Routing

Call routing is a function that routes incoming calls from customers to the most suitable agents or departments. It automatically processes calls based on skills, availability, and priority.

### Specific Routing Examples

For example, technical questions are routed to the support department, while billing-related questions are directed to the accounting team. This reduces the effort required for first-level response and allows customers to connect with the appropriate representative in the shortest time possible.

### Benefits and Effects
