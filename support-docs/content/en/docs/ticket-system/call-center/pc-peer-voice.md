## LiveAgent Voice Call Overview

Using LiveAgent's voice calls allows customers to make phone calls to agents directly from your website. To enable voice calls, you need to place a call button on any web page as a contact point.

※Using the voice call "call button" requires prior integration setup with Twilio.

## Voice Call Setup Procedure

### Creating a Twilio Button

- From the agent screen, select "Settings" > "Twilio" > "Twilio Button".

## Button Implementation and Management

- Once the input is complete, save the changes and copy the HTML code of the created call button.
- By adding this code to the page where you want the button to appear, voice calls become available.
- If you need to change the design or other settings after installing the button, you only need to modify the settings within LiveAgent - no HTML code replacement is necessary.
