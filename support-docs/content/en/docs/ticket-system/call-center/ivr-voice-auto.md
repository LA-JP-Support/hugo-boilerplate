## Basic Concepts of IVR

### Definition of IVR
**IVR (Interactive Voice Response)** is a telephone system that automatically interacts with customers who call. It is also called an "automatic voice response system."

IVR systems respond by collecting information during the interaction process and executing appropriate actions (such as transferring to the right representative or department, performing callbacks, etc.).

### How IVR Works
When customers want to contact a support team, they hear pre-recorded voice guidance and can be instantly redirected to the appropriate support team department by simply entering voice or keypad commands.

**Example:** "Thank you for calling [company name]. Please select from the following menu options. Press 1 if you would like to speak with a sales representative, or press 2 for technical support."

## Main Features of IVR

### Automatic Call Routing
- **Department-based transfer**: Automatic routing based on purpose such as sales department, technical support, accounting department
- **Priority settings**: Priority processing for VIP customers or urgent matters
- **Skill-based routing**: Direct transfer to representatives with specific expertise

### Self-Service Support
- **Automatic answers to frequently asked questions**: Providing business hours, location, and basic product information
- **Account information verification**: Automatic guidance for order status, balance inquiries, and delivery status
- **Simple procedures**: Basic procedures such as password resets and address changes

### Efficient Processing of High Call Volumes
The call volume that IVR systems can handle depends on various factors such as system capacity, configuration, and call traffic levels, but typically these systems can process large volumes of calls simultaneously, making them ideal for companies that need to handle large volumes of calls on a daily basis.
