## What is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### Basic Concept of SLA
A feature that sets target response times and resolution times for customer support and manages compliance status. It can send alerts to prevent SLA violations.

### Specific Configuration Examples
For example, you can set standards such as "initial response within 1 hour" and "resolution within 24 hours," and create a system that automatically issues warnings for unhandled tickets. This allows you to achieve both customer satisfaction and contract compliance.

## Key Features of SLA

### Main Points
- Ability to set standards for response and resolution times
- Alert notifications to prevent SLA violations
- Support for contract compliance with customers
- Visualization of team performance
- Maintenance of consistent service quality
