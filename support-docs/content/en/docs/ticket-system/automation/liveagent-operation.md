## Overview of LiveAgent Customer Support Features

LiveAgent provides not only customer support itself, but also numerous extended features that support customer service operations.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA) Management

### Basic Concept of SLA
SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a guarantee of service quality that is clearly shown to customers. In LiveAgent, it is defined as the time limit for responding to customer inquiries (tickets).

### SLA Configuration and Operation
To comply with this "time limit" in LiveAgent, you set up two components: "SLA levels" that define different time limits for different scenarios, and "SLA rules" that define the conditions for level assignment. For example, by establishing a rule such as "if the customer group is VIP," "email responses must be within 30 minutes during business hours," you can change the flow of operations.

### Benefits of SLA Operation
By establishing rules within the system, continuous SLA operation becomes easier. The operation and maintenance of SLA helps improve the quality of customer service and enhance customer satisfaction with the service.

### Business Hours Consideration
Additionally, if the help desk operating LiveAgent is not running 24/7, you can define "business hours" to enable SLA application that takes into account the help desk's operating hours.

## Business Automation Rules

### Basic Rule Functions
Rules are a mechanism for automatically processing tickets under arbitrary conditions. LiveAgent handles tasks such as changing ticket status or priority, tagging, and deleting spam or unnecessary inquiries on behalf of busy agents.

### Rule Configuration Approach
Rule creation should first be based on current business processes. Automate the routine work that occurs in business processes to improve productivity.

## Agent Motivation Management

### Purpose of Gamification
Reward agent activities through "badges" and "proficiency levels" that evaluate daily activities! The purpose of gamification is to use game methods and mechanisms to boost agent motivation and improve customer support quality and customer satisfaction.

### Performance Evaluation
Additionally, this feature makes it easy to determine whether agents are overworked.

## Ticket Management Features

### Utilizing Tags
Tags help organize, analyze, and prioritize tickets by category. By tagging tickets, you can better understand different types of support content. They can also be used to identify inquiries from VIP customers.

### Tag Flexibility
Adding tags to tickets also improves ticket searchability. Tagging can be done manually or automatically assigned through rule settings.

## Communication Efficiency

### Utilizing Frequently Used Phrases
It's tedious to write the same response over and over again. You can apply response templates when using live chat or replying to emails. During response input, you can easily call up "frequently used phrases" by entering "ctrl+space" and a "keyword."

### Phrase Usage Flexibility
You can send pre-created "frequently used phrases" as-is, or modify the expression before sending to create messages full of the agent's personality. Additionally, "frequently used phrases" can be registered separately for individual agent use, team use, and system-wide use.
