## What are Predefined Answers

Predefined Answers are templates that can be called upon when composing messages in LiveAgent, such as email replies, live chat, and internal tickets. While there is a similar feature called "Email Templates," Predefined Answers differ in that they offer capabilities like HTML tag editing and file attachments.

Predefined Answers are suitable for standardizing agent language for simple greetings and questions.
