## What are Tags

"Tags" are an important feature in SmartWeb's ticket management that enables efficient categorization and analysis. They can be manually applied to tickets by agents or automatically applied based on system rules. Using tags makes it easy to organize and optimize customer support processes.

### How to Create Tags

Creating tags can be easily done from the SmartWeb management screen. Agents can quickly identify ticket characteristics and status using visually clear color coding and understandable names.

- From the agent screen left menu, select "Settings" > "Automation" > "Tags".
- Click the "Create" button and configure the following items:
  - Tag name (e.g., "Urgent", "Under Investigation", "Resolved")
  - Text color
  - Background color

Specific use cases for tags:
- Customer inquiry types ("Billing", "Technical Support", "Returns", etc.)
- Ticket priority ("High", "Medium", "Low")
- Response status ("Unhandled", "In Progress", "Complete")

By using tags effectively, agents can:
- Rapidly categorize and distribute tickets
- Understand response status at a glance
- Perform data analysis and trend identification
- Streamline support processes

These capabilities can significantly improve customer support quality and productivity.
