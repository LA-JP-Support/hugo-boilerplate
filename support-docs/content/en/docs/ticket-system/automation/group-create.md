## What are Contact Groups

Contact Groups are a powerful classification tool that enables customer support teams to efficiently manage and organize customer information. This feature allows visual and logical tagging of "Contacts" and "Companies" associated with tickets. Through this grouping, agents can immediately understand customer characteristics and priority levels.

## How to Create Contact Groups

### Navigating to Settings

From the agent screen left menu, select "Settings" > "Automation" > "Contact Groups". On this screen, you can create new groups and manage existing groups.

### Creating and Editing New Groups

Click the "Create" button and configure the following details:

1. Group name: Use a clear name that reflects the purpose
   - Examples: "VIP Customers", "New Customers", "Priority Cases", etc.
2. Text color: Select the display color for the group name
3. Background color: Set a color that makes the group easy to identify

Specific use cases:
- Grouping customers by priority level
- Classification by specific attributes or characteristics
- Improving support efficiency and team communication

Group editing and renaming can be done by clicking the "Edit" button for each group. This flexible management feature enables up-to-date customer information classification at all times.
