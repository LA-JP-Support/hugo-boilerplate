## Ticket Overview

When you click on an individual ticket from the ticket list, you can view the ticket details (inquiry content). The mission of agents (support staff) is to provide appropriate responses to these tickets and resolve customer issues.

## Ticket Status

Tickets have the following four statuses. Handle processing according to the ticket's situation.

### New Status
This is a newly issued ticket. It's waiting for an agent to handle it. Previously, work began when staff members checked emails sent to them or reviewed inquiries from the website's contact page, but with LiveAgent, you can immediately start handling newly generated tickets just by logging in.

### Answered Status
When an agent responds, it's marked as "answered."

### Open Status
When a customer responds again to an agent's response, the status changes to "open." For example, when there's another question in response to the agent's initial answer. Depending on the situation, you can respond again or change the status to "resolved."

### Resolved Status
When an agent resolves a customer's issue, or when a customer doesn't respond to the last answer, you can change the ticket status to "resolved."

## Ticket Processing Methods

### Ticket Resolution
Use this when the ticket is resolved. Clicking this changes the status display to "resolved," allowing agents to share that the inquiry has been completed.

### Ticket Transfer
Escalate the ticket. You can select the transfer destination from individual agents or teams. Use this for appropriate ticket assignment to the right personnel.

### Spam Processing
Sort into spam folder. LiveAgent has a learning-based spam detection feature.

### Additional Processing Options

#### Ticket Postponement
Postpone ticket handling. The postponement period can be specified in the format "Month X Day X Hour XX Minute XX Second XX" for any desired date and time. You can also use simple settings by selecting from a dropdown menu: 1 hour/4 hours/1 day/2 days/1 week/1 month.

#### Ticket Deletion
Delete from the ticket list. For ticket purging (permanent deletion), please refer to "Ticket Purging and Restoration."

#### Ticket Assignment
Set the ticket assignee to "self." This clarifies the response handler in the ticket list and prevents duplicate responses to customers. We recommend performing "assignment" before handling tickets.

#### Ticket Reply
Reply via email to this ticket. After clicking, a form similar to webmail is displayed, allowing you to add recipients, enter body text, and attach files.

#### Add Note
Add internal notes. Notes can also be used for information sharing among agents.

#### Ticket Reopening
Click this to return a ticket that was once "resolved" back to "in progress" status. The button is displayed only when the ticket status is "resolved."
