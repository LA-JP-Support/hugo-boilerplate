Yes, SmartWeb's AI-integrated ticket system allows you to set up automatic replies using the rules feature.

## Available Automatic Replies

- **Email inquiries**: Automatically send confirmation emails when new tickets are created
- **Contact form submissions**: Automatic responses for receipt confirmation
- **Condition-based automatic responses**: Customization based on department or inquiry content

## Configuration Points

### Recommended: Use "Send Answer" Action

We recommend using the "send answer" action for automatic replies. This prevents infinite loops when customers also have automatic replies configured, avoiding mutual auto-response cycles.

### Maintaining Ticket Status

By enabling the "maintain ticket status" option, tickets will remain in "new" status even after automatic replies are sent, allowing them to be managed as tickets requiring attention.

## Use Cases

- Sending inquiry receipt confirmation emails
- Automatic responses outside business hours
- Standard replies for specific inquiry categories
