## What is Agent Availability

### Definition and Basic Concepts
Agent availability is a feature that allows real-time monitoring of each agent's operational status, such as "online," "offline," or "busy." It enables administrators and the entire team to instantly identify who is immediately available to respond to customer inquiries, optimizing support operations.

## Practical Benefits

### Real-time Resource Management
For example, when inquiries surge during busy periods, administrators can understand agent operational status and appropriately reallocate resources. Even in teams that combine work shifts and remote work, being able to check availability at a glance helps prevent gaps in coverage. This allows customers to receive smooth support without waiting.

### Long-term Organizational Optimization
Furthermore, this feature accumulates operational data for the entire team, providing insights to identify imbalances in work hours and overloads. In the long term, it serves as a foundation for improving appropriate shift design and personnel planning, enhancing both efficiency and customer satisfaction.
