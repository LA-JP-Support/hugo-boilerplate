## Smart Ticket Content Sharing Methods

### Using "My Tickets" in the Customer Portal

Customers can view all tickets from their past inquiries on the "My Tickets" section of the customer portal installed in LiveAgent. The shared information includes only exchanges between agents and customers, with internal information such as notes not displayed.

#### User Registration Process

When customers use My Tickets, user registration is required. By registering the email address used for inquiries, all tickets related to that user information will be linked.

### Ticket Sharing Methods (Without User Registration)

To share ticket content with customers who have not registered for My Tickets, it is necessary to provide individual ticket URLs to customers. This URL notification/sharing can be done through the following methods:

#### Individual Ticket URL Notification Settings

From the agent screen left menu, select Settings > Email > Customer Templates > Ticket Conversation History.

- Edit the "Ticket Reply" or "Chat Conversation History" template.
- By inserting and saving "Ticket URL" as a variable in the template body, it becomes possible to notify customers of individual ticket URLs with each customer interaction.
