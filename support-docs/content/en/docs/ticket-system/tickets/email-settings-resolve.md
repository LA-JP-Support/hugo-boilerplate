## Default Behavior: Automatic Ticket Reopening

By default, when new replies or additional information are received for resolved tickets, the system automatically reopens the ticket. This enables quick and seamless responses to additional comments or new questions from customers. This is an important feature that improves customer support efficiency.

### Basic Settings
For resolved tickets, the checkbox is ON by default, automatically reopening tickets when customers reply. This setting ensures continuous communication with customers even after closure.

## Behavior When Check Setting is Turned OFF

When the check setting is turned OFF, replies to resolved tickets are treated as new tickets. This method has the following characteristics:

- A new ticket code is issued
- The original ticket's history remains accessible
- Past interactions are easy to track

### Creating New Tickets
When the setting is turned OFF, customer replies are created as completely new tickets. New tickets are assigned new codes, but the original ticket's history and related information remain accessible. This enables flexible responses while maintaining consistency in support history.
