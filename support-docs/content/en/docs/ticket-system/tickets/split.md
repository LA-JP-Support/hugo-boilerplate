Yes, SmartWeb's AI-integrated ticketing system allows you to split one ticket into multiple tickets.

## Situations Where Ticket Splitting is Useful

- When one inquiry contains multiple questions
- When multiple issues have different progress statuses
- When part of the issue needs to be transferred (escalated) to another team or person

## Benefits of Splitting

- **Proper assignment to specialized departments**: Technical questions and billing questions can be assigned to different personnel
- **Prevention of missed responses**: All questions can be answered reliably
- **Improved response speed**: Each issue can be processed in parallel

## How to Split

1. Display the details screen of the ticket you want to split
2. Select "Split" from the "▼" dropdown in the upper right
3. A new ticket will be created that inherits the previous response log
4. Transfer the split ticket to the appropriate person if necessary

After splitting, both tickets remain linked and can be referenced by following the links.
