## What are Smart Tickets

### Basic Concept of Tickets
A "ticket" is a visualization of customer inquiries and communication with agents.

### Supported Inquiry Channels
Regardless of the inquiry channel used by customers, one ticket is issued per inquiry, recording all history including mutual interactions between agents and customers.

#### Main Supported Channels
- Email
- Live chat
- Phone and voice calls
- Facebook and Twitter
- Messages from web inquiry forms
- Internal tickets (internal team notes for information sharing)

## Benefits of Ticket Management

### Improved Operational Efficiency
- Makes it easier to share customer service status within the helpdesk. This leads to reduced response risks that can cause complaints, such as overlooked inquiry emails, missed responses, and duplicate replies.

### Centralized Information Management
- Regardless of the channel used by customers, one ticket is issued per problem, recording all interaction history between agents and customers. No need for transfer work to CRM or spreadsheets, streamlining support operations.

### Enhanced Searchability and Productivity
- When searching resolved tickets during customer support, detailed search conditions can be set. Quick access to the tickets you want to reference improves the speed and quality of support services.

## Ticket Processing Automation

### Automated Routing Response
To streamline ticket processing, it's possible to apply "rules" with arbitrary conditions. Conditions are determined by individual agents or teams, SLA, time rules, and other factors.
