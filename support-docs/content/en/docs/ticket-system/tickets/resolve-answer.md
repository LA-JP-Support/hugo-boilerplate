## How to Configure Response Only from "Tickets to Resolve"

### Feature Overview
If your LiveAgent account role is "Owner" or "Administrator", you can configure agents registered with the "Agent" role to only respond to tickets from the "Tickets to Resolve" section at the top of the agent panel. With this setting, "Agents" will no longer be able to open tickets from the ticket list to respond (viewing tickets is still possible).

### How It Works
When the relevant agent clicks the "Tickets to Resolve" button, the ticket with the highest priority at that moment will open. They cannot respond to arbitrary tickets against the priority order of tickets that should be handled.

### Configuration Steps

#### Step 1: Navigate to Agent Settings Screen
Expand "Settings" > "Agents" and click "Edit" for the agent you want to configure

#### Step 2: Change Team Settings
In the newly opened window, click "Team", check the specified item, and save.

### Behavior After Configuration
After configuration is complete, when the relevant agent opens a ticket from the list, a message will be displayed prompting them to respond from "Tickets to Resolve".
