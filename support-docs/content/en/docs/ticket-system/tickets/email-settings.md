## Automatic Ticket Conversion Setup for Email Accounts

LiveAgent automatically converts incoming emails into tickets by setting up an email account for inquiry emails.

### Steps to Add an Email Account

1. From the agent screen left menu, select Settings > Email > Email Accounts > Add Email Account

2. Enter the necessary information for the email account and click the "Test Settings" button

### Important Notes for Configuration

#### Required Settings
- Incoming email configuration is mandatory

#### Email Address Requirements
- The email used for account registration must be different from the "owner" and agent email addresses

#### Optional Settings
- Outgoing email configuration should only be set up if you want to send emails through a specific mail server

#### Support
- For any unclear items in the incoming/outgoing email settings, please contact your mail server administrator
