## Overview of Split Tickets

Split tickets is a feature that allows you to divide one ticket into multiple tickets, each assignable to different agents or departments. This is useful when multiple issues are included in a single ticket.

### Use Cases

For example, when a customer simultaneously submits a "login issue" and a "billing question," each can be split into independent tickets and assigned to specialized departments.

## Benefits
