## Ticket System Overview

The ticket system provides a mechanism to centrally manage all customer inquiries (email, chat, phone, social media, etc.) as "tickets". When inquiries arrive, tickets are automatically generated and assigned status levels (e.g., new, in progress, resolved).

### Benefits of Ticket Management

This prevents missed responses and duplicate handling, enabling smooth customer service. All tickets are saved as history, allowing for contextual responses while reviewing past interactions.

### Advanced Features

Furthermore, various functions such as automatic routing, ticket merging/splitting, SLA management, To Solve button, and audit logs are built-in, enabling the construction of sophisticated workflows. Additionally, features like Universal inbox and Hybrid ticket stream integrate communications across multiple channels. This provides a foundation for rapid, high-quality customer service regardless of company size.

## Key Features

### Omnichannel Support

All inquiries from email, chat, phone, social media, etc. can be managed through a single interface.

### Ticket Management and History Management

Status management and history reference make it easy to visualize response status and prevent oversights.

### Automation and Efficiency

Automatic routing, merge/split, SLA management, To Solve button, and other features improve agent efficiency and response speed.

### Cross-Channel Integration

Universal inbox and hybrid streams integrate interactions across different channels to achieve consistent responses.

### Advanced Management Features

Audit logs, internal memos, agent assignment, and other features support transparent operations and team collaboration.
