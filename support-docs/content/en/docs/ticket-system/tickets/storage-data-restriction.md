## Data Storage Limits for Smart Tickets

### Basic Data Storage Policy

SmartWeb's smart ticket system provides flexibility and convenience in user data management. There are no capacity or quantity limits for data storage, including tickets, attachments, and user forum posts. This means you can store an unlimited number of tickets and related information as your business grows.

Key features:
- Unlimited ticket creation
- Large file attachment capability
- Comprehensive storage of historical data

### Data Retention Period

SmartWeb securely retains all data throughout your contract period unless explicitly deleted. This allows you to reference important customer service records and issue resolution history over the long term. Data storage strongly supports business continuity and knowledge management.

Benefits of data retention:
- Tracking past interactions and solutions
- Compliance and audit support
- Building organizational knowledge base
