## Simultaneous Use by Multiple Operators

Yes, LiveAgent is a **team-oriented helpdesk system that allows multiple operators to use it simultaneously**.

## Agent Collision Detection

LiveAgent is equipped with the **Agent Collision Detection** feature, which prevents confusion when multiple operators try to respond to the same ticket.

### Information Displayed

| Status | Display Content |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Viewing** | Who is viewing that ticket |
| **Replying** | Who is creating a response to that ticket |

### How It Works

1. **Real-time Detection** - When a ticket is opened, other operators are immediately notified of the situation
2. **Duplicate Response Prevention** - A warning appears when trying to open a ticket already being handled
3. **To Solve Algorithm Integration** - Works with automatic assignment, preventing tickets being handled from being assigned to other operators

## Benefits of Team Use

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Improved Efficiency** | Eliminates duplicate work on the same ticket |
| **Enhanced Customer Experience** | Prevents confusion from multiple responses to one inquiry |
| **Team Collaboration** | Real-time awareness of who is handling what |

## Available Plans

The Agent Collision Detection feature is available on **all LiveAgent plans** (Small, Medium, Large, Enterprise).

## Adding Accounts

When expanding team members, additional operator accounts are required.

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Minimum Accounts** | 3 or more |
| **Addition Method** | Can be added anytime from admin panel |
| **Pricing** | Monthly fee based on number of accounts |

SmartWeb's plans include support for adding LiveAgent accounts.
