## About Manual Creation of Smart Tickets

LiveAgent tickets can be created from each configured channel, as well as manually created by agents themselves. The types of tickets that can be newly created are as follows:

### New Ticket

A ticket created from "New Ticket" is equivalent to creating a new email to a customer. You need to create the "To (= customer)," "Sender (can be set by team)," "Subject," and "Body."

### Knowledge Base Related Creation

#### New Knowledge Base Article

You can create new articles to post to the knowledge base. Created articles can be published on either LiveAgent's customer portal (FAQ site) or the internal knowledge base. This is equivalent to creating an "Article" from "Knowledge Base" in the agent screen.

#### Create Forum Topic

Create topics to be posted on the user forum. This feature is equivalent to creating a "Forum" from "Knowledge Base" in the agent screen.

#### Create Suggestion

Create a new feedback (suggestion) category. This feature is equivalent to creating a "Feedback Category" from "Knowledge Base" in the agent screen.

### Internal Ticket Creation

#### New Internal Ticket

Create tickets to be shared between agents or teams. Creation requires entering "Team," "Agent," "Subject," "Note," and "Customer."

The "Customer" field is optional, but if entered, this ticket will be associated with customer information. Since it is treated as an internal memo (note) at the time of new creation, even if customer information is associated, no email will be automatically sent to the customer. If necessary, you can send an email to the customer from the "Reply" operation.

### Social Media Posts

#### New Tweet

This appears when a Twitter account is linked to LiveAgent. Select the Twitter account you want to post from the dropdown menu and send a message, and the post will be reflected on the specified account's timeline.

#### Post to Facebook

This appears when a Facebook account is linked to LiveAgent. Select the Facebook page you want to post to from the dropdown menu and send a message, and the post will be reflected on the specified Facebook page's timeline. ※Thumbnail images and page information display when attaching URL links is not supported.

### Call Function

#### New Twilio Call

This appears when Twilio is linked to LiveAgent. Enter the "Destination (customer's phone number)" and select the "Caller" number to make a phone call from LiveAgent.
