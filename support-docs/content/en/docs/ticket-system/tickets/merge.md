Yes, SmartWeb's AI-integrated ticketing system allows you to merge multiple tickets into one.

## Situations where ticket merging is useful

- When the same customer contacts you about the same issue via both email and chat
- When multiple tickets are created for the same content
- When inquiries are scattered and management becomes complicated

## Benefits of merging

- **Prevention of duplicate responses**: Prevents mistakes where multiple agents respond to the same inquiry
- **Centralized history**: All interactions can be viewed in a single thread
- **Improved response quality**: Eliminates the need to make customers repeat the same explanation

## How to operate

1. Open the ticket you want to merge and select "Merge" from the "More" button
2. Enter the ticket number of the destination ticket
3. Select tag and recipient merge options as needed
4. Click the "Merge" button to execute

**Note**: Merging cannot be undone. Please confirm the destination ticket number before executing.
