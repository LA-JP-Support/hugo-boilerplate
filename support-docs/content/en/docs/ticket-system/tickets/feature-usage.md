# Using GeoIP Functionality

## What is GeoIP

With GeoIP functionality, you can automatically retrieve and display location information of your website visitors.

## Available Information

### Location Details
- Visitor's country
- Approximate city name
- Estimated language usage

## Benefits of Use

### Business Application Scenarios
- Automatically route overseas inquiries to English support teams
- Analyze regional inquiry trends
- Understand response times considering time zone differences

## Configuration Method

You can enable it from "Settings" → "System" → "GeoIP" in the admin panel.

## Important Considerations

### Accuracy Limitations
- Since it's based on IP address determination, it's not 100% accurate
- VPN users may show different locations than their actual location
