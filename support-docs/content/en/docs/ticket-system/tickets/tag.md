## What is the Smart Ticket Tag Feature

By adding arbitrary tags to tickets, you can streamline the identification of frequently inquired products and categorization of inquiry content.

## Tag Management and Usage Methods

From the agent screen left menu, select Settings > Automation > Tags > Create.

- Click the "Create" button, set the "Tag Name," "Text Color," and "Background Color" to complete creation. For editing such as name changes, click "Edit" for each tag.

### Adding Tags to Tickets
