## Agent Ranking Overview

Agent Ranking is a feature that quantifies and ranks each agent's performance based on customer feedback and support achievements. It serves as a direct indicator of customer satisfaction and helps visualize service quality.

### How Ranking Works

For example, when customers provide evaluations through surveys after support sessions end, that data is automatically aggregated and reflected in the rankings. Managers can use this to identify excellent agents and leverage the information for recognition and incentive programs.

### Utilizing Rankings

It's also possible to identify agents who need improvement, playing a significant role as guidance for education and training. Ranking results also contribute to motivation enhancement.
