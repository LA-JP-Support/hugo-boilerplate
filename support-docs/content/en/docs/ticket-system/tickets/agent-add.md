## Overview of Adding Agents

### Instant Addition Features
Even when you need to quickly increase the number of agents for urgent situations, you can add them instantly by yourself.

There is no need to contact the operating company (InterWork), submit applications, or wait for configuration.

## How to Change the Number of Agents

### Steps for Adding and Removing
You can add/remove agents in **"Settings" - "Agents"** from the agent login screen.

### Notes Regarding Charges
The changed usage fees will be reflected in your next bill.

*Billing is based on the maximum number created during the current month's usage period, so even if you delete agents after adding them, they will still be subject to charges.

## System Specification Changes

### Simplification of My Account Settings
Due to specification changes from August 21, 2018, it is no longer necessary to set the maximum number of agents in My Account (management screen).
