## Mechanism for Associating Ticket Reply Emails

### Email Subject Line and Automatic Association

When sending an email to a customer from a ticket, the [ticket number] is automatically added to the subject line. This mechanism allows support teams to efficiently track communication with customers. For example, the ticket number is inserted into the subject line in a format like [#12345] Regarding Support Request.

SmartWeb's smart ticket system makes email reply tracking and management easy through this unique automatic tagging feature. Support staff can always maintain context of conversations through the ticket number.

### Handling Replies from Different Email Addresses

Even if a user replies from a different email address (personal email, company email, forwarded email, etc.), as long as the email subject contains the [ticket number], it will automatically be associated with the original ticket.

This flexible association mechanism provides the following benefits:

- Conversation tracking is possible even when customers use different email accounts
- Improved efficiency for support teams
- Centralized ticket management is achieved

Specific association flow:
1. Support staff sends email from ticket
2. [Ticket number] is automatically inserted into email subject
3. Customer replies from any email address
4. System recognizes ticket number in subject and associates with original ticket

Through this process, SmartWeb's smart ticket system achieves seamless communication management even in complex customer support environments.
