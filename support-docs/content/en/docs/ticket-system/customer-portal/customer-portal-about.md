## Customer Portal Overview
### What is a Customer Portal
A **customer portal (support portal)** is a customer-facing self-service hub that enables businesses to operate 24/7. To provide the best customer service, you need to provide all customers with the best information, and even during hours when customer service is unavailable, the LiveAgent customer portal can provide the necessary content.
