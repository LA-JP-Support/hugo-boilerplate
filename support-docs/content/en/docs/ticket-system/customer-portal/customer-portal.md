## Customer Portal Overview

In LiveAgent, you can build a customer portal by combining three types of content: "Knowledge Base (FAQ)", "User Forums", and "Feedback".

For system configuration of the customer portal, please refer to "Basic Customer Portal Settings".

## How to Create a Customer Portal

From the agent screen, select "Settings" > "Knowledge Base" to display the customer portal management screen. From this screen, you can create articles (content) or files (directories).

### Types of Customer Portal Content

Create portal configuration files from the "Create" dropdown menu. The files you can create are as follows:

- [Articles](#createcontents): Create content articles such as FAQs
- [Categories](#createcategory): Create folders (hierarchical structure) within the customer portal
- [Forums](#createforum): Create user forums
- [Feedback Categories](#createfeedback): Create forms to receive feedback from customers

### Creating Articles

Create content articles that form the core of the customer portal. On the portal, they are displayed with a "file" icon and article title. Articles can be created using either WYSIWYG rich text editing or HTML tag editing.
