## The Importance of Self-Service Customer Support Environment

Many customers try to resolve issues on their own before directly contacting support. When customers can resolve more problems through self-service, it reduces concerns and workload for agents (support staff).

Building a self-service customer support portal enables you to provide support outside business hours and streamline responses to frequently asked questions while reducing effort.

## Key Customer Support Strategies

### Knowledge Base: Building a 24/7 FAQ Site

Provide your customers with valuable information you have in the form of FAQs or knowledge bases. Start by simply creating categories where you want to store information, then add as many articles as you like to those categories.

#### Key Points for Creating a Knowledge Base
- Write articles simply
- Organize by categories
- Create a structure that's easy for customers to search

### User Forums: Two-Way Communication with the Community

Your customer community wants to talk to each other within forums and exchange experiences about your company, products, or services. Your customer portal allows you to set up various specialized forums.

#### Key Points for Forum Management
- Notification system for agents
- Quick question responses
- Community discussion management

### Feedback: Leveraging Customer Voice for Product Improvement

Your customers are the best source of information about your products and services. Have them post suggestions and ideas for new features, or report evaluations of changes. Or have them vote on published items to determine priorities.

#### Methods for Collecting Feedback
- Soliciting new feature suggestions
- Evaluating changes
- Customer voting for prioritization
