## What is Multi Knowledge Base

A feature that allows you to independently manage multiple knowledge bases (portals) by product or brand. You can deploy optimized KBs for multiple sites with a single LiveAgent account.

### Benefits of Use

For example, you can build one KB dedicated to Product A and another dedicated to Product B, providing each with designs and URLs tailored to their respective brands. Management is centralized through a common administrative interface, reducing operational overhead.

For companies expanding across multiple brands or languages, this offers improved flexibility and efficiency in management.

### Key Features

**Key Points:**

- Independent management of multiple KBs/portals possible
- Customization support for each brand or product
- Unified operations through common management
- Individual domain and design settings possible
- Optimal for multi-language and multi-brand deployment
