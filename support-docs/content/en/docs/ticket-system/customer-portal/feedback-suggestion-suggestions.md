A feature that provides a feedback board where customers can easily post opinions and ideas, and manages this content as votes and tickets. This makes it easier to reflect customer voices in products and encourages engagement in development and support.

For example, by installing "feedback buttons" on web pages, when customers submit improvement suggestions and ideas, they are automatically generated as tickets that staff can immediately review and respond to.
