## About the Customer Portal's "My Page"

The customer portal allows customers to use product/service FAQs (knowledge base), view and reply to their previous inquiries, and provides limited access to internal knowledge base for support agents.

## How to Access My Page

To use the "My Page" feature of the support portal, access it from the "Login" button in the upper right corner of the support portal.

- For customer use, account registration is required before logging in. Register using the email address used when making inquiries.

- For agent use, use the agent's login credentials.

## Customer My Page Features

### Checking Inquiry History

After customers log into My Page, clicking "My Tickets" in the login information area in the upper right will display a list of tickets associated with this customer. You can check response logs for previous inquiries, progress status, and last update dates.

### Replying to Inquiries and Reopening Cases

In addition to viewing tickets, customers can reply to agents and reopen inquiries. Also, if the customer portal administrator has enabled ticket creation ("Submit New Ticket" feature), customers can make new inquiries from My Page.

## Agent My Page Features

### Access to Internal Knowledge Base

LiveAgent's support portal can not only publish customer-facing FAQ articles but also build knowledge bases for internal agent use. For agents to reference internally published knowledge bases, they log into the support portal's "My Page" using their agent ID. Internally published knowledge is tagged with "internal".
