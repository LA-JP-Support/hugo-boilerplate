## Customer Forum Overview

### Purpose of Forum Feature
A forum feature where customers can post questions and opinions to each other, enabling both community activation and support load reduction. Tickets are automatically generated when posts are made, and staff can review them as needed.

### Support Mechanism
For example, when a user posts a consultation about "usage" or "troubleshooting" in the forum, not only can other users provide answers, but agents can also step in via tickets when necessary. This enables "self-resolution" support.

## Community Support Features

### Hybrid Support Experience
Achieves a hybrid support experience that combines community mutual assistance with agent intervention at appropriate timing.

## Key Benefits

### Community Activation
- Provides a platform for customer-to-customer questions and information sharing
- Fosters community development and strengthens brand loyalty

### Support Efficiency
- Posted content is converted to tickets and delivered to agents
- Promotes self-resolution and reduces support load
- Agents can intervene only when necessary
