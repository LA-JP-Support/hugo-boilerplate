## Levels Overview

The Levels feature is a system that visualizes agent growth and achievements while improving motivation.

### Purpose and Mechanism of Levels

This feature visualizes agent growth by awarding titles such as "Novice," "Professional," and "King of Customer Support" as agents achieve certain milestones. Achieved levels are permanently saved and serve as proof of motivation and skill improvement.

### Level Promotion Features

Agents are promoted to the next "level" each time they achieve targets such as the number of ticket responses or chat sessions handled, which can stimulate other agents and improve motivation. Administrators can flexibly set level names and conditions according to company culture and HR policies, building a structure that fits the organizational culture. Once achieved, levels are retained and can be used as indicators for long-term evaluation of agent performance.

### Key Points
