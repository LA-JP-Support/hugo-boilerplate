## What is Multi-Channel Support

A "channel" is a means for customers to communicate with support agents.

You probably already have several channels, such as email, phone, Facebook pages, etc. "Multi-channel" refers to bringing together these multiple channels into one unified system.

With multi-channel support capabilities, support agents can handle all customer channels through LiveAgent alone, eliminating the need to switch between different systems for each channel or manage separate IDs and accounts.

## LiveAgent's Support Channels

### Standard Channels

#### Email

Customer emails and reply emails that were previously managed within individual agent PCs are now consolidated in one place within LiveAgent as emails from all customers, ensuring they are never lost.

#### Contact Forms

Contact Forms

Unlike regular emails, contact forms allow customers to provide necessary information as required fields to answer their questions and requests, improving customer service efficiency. With just a few minutes of setup, you can easily receive customer requests and questions.

#### Live Chat

Live Chat

By simply placing a chat button on your website, you can provide instant support through chat. Agents can handle chat conversations with up to 10 customers simultaneously. For example, in an online shop, you can promote purchases by immediately answering customer questions before they buy.

#### Phone and Voice Conversations

Phone and Voice Conversations

Regular customer phone calls are received directly through LiveAgent. Simply by attaching a headset to your PC running LiveAgent, it transforms into contact center IP phone equipment. Of course, voice conversations with customer PCs are also possible in addition to phone calls.

*Phone usage requires a separate contract with a cloud-based IP phone provider (Twilio).

### Social Media Channels

#### Facebook

Facebook

Monitor multiple Facebook pages you manage and create tickets whenever posts or comments are received, allowing immediate responses from within LiveAgent. New posts are also possible. The key feature is that it can operate without linking to agents' personal Facebook accounts.

#### Twitter

Twitter

Monitor multiple Twitter accounts you own and respond to tweets, mentions, and retweets from within LiveAgent. Additionally, by registering specific keywords (such as product names), you can automatically capture tweets containing those keywords and convert them into tickets. You can then retweet or comment on them.

### Customer Portal Channels

#### User Forums
