## Social Listening Overview

### Listening on X (formerly Twitter)
SmartWeb can monitor specific hashtags and keywords on X (formerly Twitter) to efficiently track conversations about your brand. Real-time data collection provides the following benefits:

- Quickly capture authentic customer feedback
- Monitor brand reactions and reputation
- Identify potential issues and improvement opportunities early

### Limitations of Listening Features
Current social listening functionality is limited to basic monitoring and does not support more advanced analytics. Specifically:

- Basic keyword and hashtag tracking is available
- Sentiment analysis and detailed trend analysis are planned for future feature expansion

### Listening on Facebook and Instagram
On Facebook and Instagram, comments on posts and @mentions can be automatically converted into tickets. This functionality allows you to:

- Quickly manage customer feedback
- Never miss important customer communications
- Streamline responses across multiple social platforms

By leveraging these listening features, companies can strengthen two-way communication with customers and gain real-time insights into brand reputation and customer voices.
