## Social Media Integration Methods

### Supported Social Media Platforms
Using SmartWeb's LiveAgent functionality, you can efficiently manage Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter) posts and messages. Communications from these social media platforms can be automatically converted into tickets for centralized management. The main features include:

- No need to log into each social media platform individually - handle everything from LiveAgent
- Real-time message reception and reply capabilities
- Integrated management of multiple social media channels
- Improved customer service efficiency and reduced response times

This functionality enables seamless customer support on social media platforms and helps improve customer satisfaction.

### LINE Integration
For LINE integration, a separate optional setup (paid) is required, so please contact us for consultation. LINE is one of Japan's most popular messaging apps and has become an important customer communication channel for many businesses. With additional setup, LINE customer support can be managed as efficiently as other social media platforms.
