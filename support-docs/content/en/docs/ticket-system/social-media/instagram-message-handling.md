## Instagram Direct Message Support

### Current Support Status
We apologize, but we do not support direct messaging due to Meta's policies. Currently, SmartWeb cannot directly integrate with Instagram direct messages (DMs). This is due to technical constraints between platforms and Meta's API policies.

### Alternative Contact Methods
To ensure communication with our customers, we provide the following alternative methods:
- Email support
- Chatbot
- Contact forms
- Support through official social media accounts

Through these methods, we provide quick and effective customer support.

### Future Response
SmartWeb continues to consider future platform expansion. We regularly evaluate the possibility of implementing Instagram messaging functionality in response to changes in Meta's policies and technical developments.

### Notice to Customers
We deeply apologize that inquiries via Instagram are not possible. By using alternative methods, we strive to provide the quickest and most courteous response possible. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

When you need assistance, please choose one of our other contact methods.
