## Overview of Viber Support

### Viber Messaging Support

Yes, SmartWeb supports Viber messaging, but since regular phone number-linked Viber accounts cannot be integrated, creating a Viber bot account is necessary. By utilizing Viber bots, you can achieve the following benefits:

- Automated messaging
- Improved customer support efficiency

### Important Notes on Viber Account Integration

Unlike regular personal Viber accounts, you need to create a dedicated Viber bot account. This dedicated account enables advanced features such as:

- Automated response systems
- Message tracking
- Enhanced customer experience

### Viber Bot Setup and Features

Setting up a Viber bot account is relatively simple and can be easily done from the SmartWeb dashboard. Key features include:

- Advanced messaging through API integration
- Template message creation
- Rich content delivery (images, links, etc.)

### Recommended Use Cases

Viber bots are particularly effective in the following business scenarios:

- Customer support
- Marketing campaigns
- Automated notification systems

The integration process is intuitive and designed so that even those without technical knowledge can easily configure it.
