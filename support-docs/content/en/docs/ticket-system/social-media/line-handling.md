## LINE Support Overview

### Support Features
SmartWeb's LINE support feature is a solution that efficiently converts LINE messages from customers into customer support tickets. This feature provides the following benefits:

- Centralized management of LINE messages in real-time
- Quick response by multiple agents
- Automatic recording of customer communication history

As a key feature, received LINE messages are automatically imported into the ticket system, enabling the support team to respond quickly. Since the context and history of conversations with customers are also saved simultaneously, consistent support responses are possible.

### Usage Conditions
The LINE support feature is an additional option for SmartWeb. The following steps are required for usage:

- Separate application required
- Monthly additional fees apply (paid option)
- Integration setup with LINE Official Account

With implementation, companies can manage customer communication more seamlessly and efficiently. This solution is particularly suitable for companies that prioritize mobile-centered communication.
