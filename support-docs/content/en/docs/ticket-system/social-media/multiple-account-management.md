Yes, SmartWeb's AI-integrated ticketing system allows you to centrally manage multiple social media accounts from a single screen.

## Supported Management Options

- **Multiple accounts within the same platform**: Integrated management of multiple accounts organized by brand, region, etc.
- **Cross-platform integration**: Manage different social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X (Twitter), WhatsApp, and LINE from a single interface

You can efficiently handle all inquiries without the hassle of switching between accounts. Inquiries from email, chat, phone, and social media are automatically converted into tickets, preventing any missed responses.
