## Overview of Social Media Customer Support Integration Feature

SmartWeb's social media integration feature is an innovative solution that centrally manages inquiries from major social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), WhatsApp, Viber, and LINE through LiveAgent's unified inbox. It evolves from the traditional inefficient method of "logging into each social media platform for individual responses" to a next-generation customer support system that "manages all social media from a single dashboard."

## Key Features of the Integrated Platform

### Universal Inbox

LiveAgent collects each comment, post, and message from social media platforms in the inbox (Universal Inbox) and converts them into tickets. Agents can reply to each ticket with the same operational experience as Facebook.

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Social Listening and Brand Management

Did you know that out of 26 dissatisfied customers, only 1 will directly complain? Most dissatisfied customers simply turn to the internet and share their experiences with others.

LiveAgent's social monitoring tools allow you to catch these indirect tweets and address them before they go viral and damage your company's reputation.

### 2. Competitive Advantage Through Real-Time Response

LiveAgent provides real-time notifications about new tweets, allowing you to stay ahead of the game. This enables:

- **Rapid problem resolution**: Early response before issues escalate
- **Positive engagement**: Active response to favorable posts
- **Competitive analysis**: Monitor mentions of competitors

### 3. Efficient Customer Service Operations

**Significant time savings**: Reduced clicks and monitoring targets (accounts, devices) allow everything to be executed from a single dashboard

**Enhanced security**: By executing everything from one dashboard, there's no need to share social media login credentials with multiple support staff. This reduces the risk of hacking, data breaches, or computers left logged into corporate social media accounts.

### 4. Marketing and Sales Integration

**Segmentation marketing**: Excellent for running multiple segmentation marketing campaigns. For example, VIP customers receive pop-up sale messages, while different audience segments (e.g., people with reservations on specific days) can broadcast sudden changes in business hours.

**Sales opportunity utilization**: Example when a customer tweets about an upgrade: While replying to the tweet within the help desk, you can click the PipeDrive integration button to add a new deal directly from LiveAgent.
