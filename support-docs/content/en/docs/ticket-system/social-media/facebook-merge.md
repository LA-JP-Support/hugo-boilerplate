## Facebook Integration Overview
Facebook Integration is a feature that allows you to handle Facebook page messages, comments, and post reactions directly within the LiveAgent interface. Even when customers make inquiries or leave comments via Facebook, everything is centrally managed as tickets, enabling quick and efficient responses.

## Key Features and Benefits

### Centralized Management and Efficient Response
For example, questions or complaints posted on your company's official Facebook page won't be missed, and support staff can handle them through the standard ticket processing workflow. Even when managing multiple pages or brand accounts, everything can be managed collectively, significantly reducing operational burden.

### Enhanced Customer Engagement
Since customers can easily make inquiries through Facebook, a familiar platform, this leads to improved customer experience and stronger engagement.

## Key Benefits
- Centralized management of Facebook page messages and comments
- Quick response without missing customer voices
- Efficient management of multiple pages
