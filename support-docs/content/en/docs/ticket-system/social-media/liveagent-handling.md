## What is Active Support

A support method that listens to customer voices exchanged outside of support channels, such as on social media, and aims to solve problems. Going beyond conventional user support, this method has become recognized primarily among large enterprises as a way to improve customer satisfaction and corporate value.

LiveAgent currently supports integration with Twitter and Facebook pages among the many existing social media platforms.

### Challenges of Social Media Support

While active support can be easily started with just social media accounts, it has the drawback of requiring unexpectedly time-consuming tracking and collection of posts.

For example, using Twitter's keyword search to review all constantly updated posts while conducting regular support operations is not a simple task. Additionally, regarding response logs, simply posting "replies" or "favorites" to the timeline doesn't allow for the accumulation of visualized "customer voices."

### LiveAgent's Solution for Social Media Support

LiveAgent automatically converts time-consuming collection work into tickets, enabling the creation of an environment where support staff can focus on support responses.

## Social Media Platform Integration

### Twitter Integration Features

LiveAgent converts and collects all notifications (mentions) to support accounts and keyword search results into tickets in real-time. From these tickets, agents can respond to customers through replies, retweets, and other interactions.

Ticket management, when used in conjunction with features like "tags," can visualize the positive/negative sentiment of customer voices in graphs or create statistics on inquiry content trends. It's also possible to engage in communication with customers through new posts to the timeline.

### Facebook Page Integration Features

All comments posted to corporate/organizational Facebook pages are converted and collected into tickets. Customer support is provided by replying to these tickets or giving "likes."

Integration with LiveAgent only requires an agent with administrator or owner privileges to register and configure an existing Facebook page. There's no need for individual agent Facebook accounts to be linked with the Facebook page.
