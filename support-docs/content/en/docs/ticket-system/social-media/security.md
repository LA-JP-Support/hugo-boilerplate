## Security Measures Overview

### Data Management Security

SmartWeb's security system adopts the latest encryption technology and strict access control. Login information for each social media account is safely stored in a multi-layered defense dedicated system, manageable only by authorized support agents. Specifically, we implement the following measures:

- Data protection through 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption
- Implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Regular security audits and risk assessments
- Access management through IP address restrictions

### Account Management Efficiency

We achieve centralized account management while avoiding traditional distributed management by multiple personnel. This provides the following benefits:

- Significant reduction in password leak risks
- Tracking of account access history
- Unified permission management system
- Swift and secure account operations

Support agents receive specialized training and manage accounts according to strict guidelines. We utilize advanced management tools such as LiveAgent and FlowHunt, always adhering to the latest security standards.
