## Basics of WhatsApp's 24-Hour Restriction

### What is the Message Sending Time Restriction

WhatsApp business communication has an important rule of replying within 24 hours. This time restriction is established to ensure real-time and smooth communication with users. Specifically, after receiving a message from a user, you can send free-form messages within 24 hours. This makes it possible to respond to customer inquiries in a timely manner.

### Message Sending Rules After 24 Hours

After 24 hours have passed, you can only send pre-approved template messages. This restriction has the following meanings and benefits:

- Privacy protection: Spam prevention and maintaining quality customer experience
- Structured communication: Consistent messaging through standardized texts
- Efficient customer support: Quick responses using pre-prepared templates

Main examples of template messages:
- Customer support-related standard texts
- Order confirmation messages
- Delivery status notifications
- Auto-response messages

By properly utilizing this 24-hour rule, you can improve the quality of business communication through WhatsApp.
