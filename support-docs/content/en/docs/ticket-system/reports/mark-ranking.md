## Overview of Benchmarks and Leaderboards

### Purpose of the Feature
A feature that compares agent performance metrics (response counts, call counts, online time, etc.) with other agents in real-time and displays them as rankings. It aims to balance performance visualization with motivation enhancement.

### Motivation Enhancement Mechanism
For example, by visualizing daily response activities, it can promote positive behaviors such as "wanting to catch up" rather than just "preventing laziness." Rankings can be switched by different periods such as "today," "last week," "this month," which helps with goal setting and reflection. Furthermore, when linked with recognition systems and incentive programs, it can also enhance team competitiveness and unity.

## Key Features and Benefits

### Team Productivity Enhancement
