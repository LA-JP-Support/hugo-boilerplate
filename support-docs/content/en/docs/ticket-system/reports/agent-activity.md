## Detailed Report Items

### Analysis Summary

Displays aggregated data from various reports in graph format. This is the ideal report for understanding the performance overview of the help desk department. To view details of each report, click "View Details" in the upper right of each report item.

### Performance Reports

Reports the ticket handling history of the entire help desk in graphs and tables. Search criteria include date specification as well as daily, weekly, and monthly displays, and you can optionally select agents, channels, teams, and tags, enabling report viewing tailored to daily management tasks.

### Agent Reports

Displays customer support reports for individual agents in graphs and tables. Search conditions can include additional channels, teams, and tags beyond the period for creating detailed reports. "Agent Reports" allow you to compare processing volumes per hour and customer evaluations at a glance. This is the ideal report for checking agent response quality.

### Team Reports

Displays customer support reports for "teams" organized within LiveAgent in graphs and tables. Search conditions can include additional channels, agents, and tags beyond the period for creating detailed reports. By comparing response situations between teams divided by business content, it becomes easier to understand trends in customer inquiry content.

### Channel Reports

Displays response reports for each inquiry channel used by customers in graphs and tables. Search conditions can include additional agents, teams, and tags beyond the period for creating detailed reports. Analyze channel usage trends to strengthen communication with customers.

### Tag Reports

Displays response reports for each "tag" attached to tickets in graphs and tables. Search conditions can include additional agents, teams, and channels beyond the period for close-up analysis. By preparing and operating "tags" for customer inquiry types and targets, you can obtain data such as "Service A had X sales inquiries and Y support inquiries" without manual aggregation.

### Agent Rankings

Displays a list of agent evaluations (good/bad) received from customers. Since you can view comments along with customer evaluations, you can easily report how much each agent contributed to customers.
