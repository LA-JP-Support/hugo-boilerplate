## Importance of Customer Service Reporting

### The Need for Report Review
Regularly reviewing reports is essential when using online customer service software. This ensures you meet customer needs and expectations while improving business practices, products, and the services you provide.

### Specific Use Cases
**Specific Example:** Suppose you think your customer support team is doing a great job because the average ticket resolution time is under 8 minutes. However, when you investigate further and check agent reviews, you notice that agents are repeatedly receiving negative reviews. This may indicate that they're rushing to respond to all tickets, sacrificing service quality for speed.
