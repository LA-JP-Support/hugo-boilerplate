## Work Reports Overview

Work reports are important analytical tools in SmartWeb's support management. You can visualize detailed business performance for assigned agents, departments, teams, specific tags, support channels, and more. The CSV export functionality makes it easy to perform data analysis and integrate with external tools. This contributes to improving team productivity and optimizing customer support strategies.

## How to Create Work Reports

Access the "Reports" section from the left menu of the agent screen. By selecting the desired report type, detailed business analysis is possible. Main analysis targets include:

- Agent-specific performance
- Department/team response status

### Exporting Reports
To enhance data analysis convenience, we provide CSV format export functionality. The specific steps are as follows:
