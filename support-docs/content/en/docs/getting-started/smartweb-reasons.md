## 5 Reasons to Choose SmartWeb

### 1. Comprehensive Delivery of Two Solutions

SmartWeb provides two solutions: "AI Customer Support" and "AI Content Creation & Web Development." We comprehensively support business growth from streamlining customer support to accelerating content marketing.

### 2. Complete Integration of LiveAgent and FlowHunt AI

Complete integration of the globally used help desk system "LiveAgent" and AI automated response platform "FlowHunt." You can immediately build a high-functionality customer support system without the hassle of individual implementation and setup.

### 3. Delivery with Initial Setup Completed

SmartWeb is delivered with initial setup already completed. Even companies without IT staff can start operations immediately.

### 4. Continuous Operational Support

We provide continuous operational support and improvement recommendations after implementation. The SmartWeb team handles account setup, channel integration, knowledge base construction, and initial AI response learning.

### 5. Results-Backed Effectiveness

SmartWeb has achieved concrete results including 73% reduction in response time, 82% reduction in support workload, and 70% reduction in article creation time.

## Comparison with Self-Implementation

While you can use LiveAgent and FlowHunt individually on your own, this incurs labor costs for setup and operation. SmartWeb's implementation service allows you to start using it immediately even without IT staff, and we provide continuous support.
