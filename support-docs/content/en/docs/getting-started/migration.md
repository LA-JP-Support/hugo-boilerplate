To use SmartWeb's AI customer support features (AI chatbot, AI email creation, AI answer assist, etc.), you need to migrate your ticket system to LiveAgent.

## Easy switching with migration plugins

Migration plugins are available from major ticket systems such as Zendesk and Freshdesk. Using these plugins, you can import existing FAQ data and ticket history as-is.

## Migration process

1. **Export data from current system** - Export existing ticket history, FAQ data, customer information, etc.
2. **Import to LiveAgent** - Automatically import data using migration plugins
3. **Configure AI customer support features** - Enable AI functionality through integration with FlowHunt
