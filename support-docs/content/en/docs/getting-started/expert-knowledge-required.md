## No IT expertise required

### Initial setup supported by specialist staff
Our staff will handle the configuration. We will provide guidance and support for any settings that require customer-side configuration, so you can rest assured. During initial implementation, our specialist staff will carefully support everything from email system environment setup to configuration. Customers only need to provide minimal information and perform simple verification tasks.

### User-friendly management interface
Advanced IT knowledge is not required for daily operations. The management interface features an intuitive UI, and basic operations can be learned with a feel similar to email software. For example, user management, email settings, security settings, and more can be performed with simple operations such as:

- Add and delete user accounts with a single click
- Intuitive drag & drop email sorting
- Clear icons and menu structure
- Easy password and security setting changes

Furthermore, LiveAgent and FlowHunt features dramatically improve email management efficiency. Advanced email management becomes possible through intuitive operations without complex settings or technical knowledge. The system is designed so that anyone can easily utilize it without specialized IT skills.
