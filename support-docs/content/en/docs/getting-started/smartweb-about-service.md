## Four Functions of AI Customer Support

Why not transform the manuals and FAQs scattered throughout your company into a "highly capable AI support representative"? SmartWeb uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to quickly search for only the necessary information from manuals, FAQs, and documents to generate optimal responses.

### AI Chatbot

Simply install on your website and AI trained on your manuals, FAQs, and product information provides 24-hour support. AI trained in Japanese automatically responds in approximately 100 languages including English and Chinese. It operates during nights and holidays, eliminating missed opportunities outside business hours.

### AI-Integrated Ticket System

Centrally manage inquiries from multiple channels - email, chat, phone, social media - on a single screen. Achieve zero missed responses through automatic ticketing and significantly reduce staff burden through integration with AI response assistance.

### AI Email Response Creation

When inquiry emails are received, AI analyzes the content and automatically creates response drafts by referencing your company's knowledge base. Staff only need to review the content and send it. Significantly reduce response time per email and enable faster responses to more customers.

### AI Response Assistant

AI instantly refines response texts created by staff. Improve, expand, or simplify text with instructions like "more polite," "concise," or "add explanations for technical terms." Adjust writing style from casual to business to achieve consistently high-quality responses.

## Two Functions of AI Content Creation & Web Development

FlowHunt AI efficiently auto-generates drafts for specialized glossaries, blog articles, and video summary articles. Metadata and structured data required for SEO are automatically added, enabling you to quickly create search engine-friendly content.

### AI Content Creation

FlowHunt's multi-agent AI automatically generates SEO-optimized blog articles and specialized glossaries. Automate everything from research to writing and proofreading, reducing article creation time by 70%.

### Hugo High-Speed Web Development

Hugo, developed in Go language, is the world's fastest static site generator that creates pages in millisecond units. It eliminates security risks by requiring no database and achieves ultra-fast display through CDN distribution. It supports continuous content marketing while keeping operational costs low through serverless architecture.

## Implementation Support

SmartWeb provides initial setup and implementation support by dedicated staff, enabling smooth implementation even for companies without IT personnel. The SmartWeb team handles account setup, channel integration, knowledge base construction, and initial AI response learning, and continues to provide operational support and improvement suggestions after implementation.
