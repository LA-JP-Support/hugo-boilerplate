## Basic Strategies for Addressing Incorrect AI Responses

### Correcting and Updating the Knowledge Base

You can improve it by correcting and updating the underlying knowledge content. If you modify web pages, the system will automatically re-learn during the next crawl. Specifically, by replacing incorrect information or inappropriate expressions with accurate information, you can continuously improve the AI's response accuracy. An accurate knowledge base is a crucial element that enhances the reliability and usefulness of AI assistants.

For example:
- Updating technical details
- Adding latest trends and information
- Clarifying ambiguous expressions
- Correcting information that could lead to misunderstandings

### Adding Customized Responses

Additionally, you can register individual FAQs, making it possible to provide specific answers to designated questions. This approach is effective for providing accurate and consistent responses to specific important questions or questions that may frequently be misunderstood. Customized responses are particularly useful in the following cases:

- Explaining complex product specifications
- Service-specific detailed information
- Clear explanations to resolve common misunderstandings or confusion
- Providing company or product-specific knowledge

Through this method, you can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of AI responses and enhance user experience. Continuous updates and improvements are the key to maintaining the quality of AI assistants.
