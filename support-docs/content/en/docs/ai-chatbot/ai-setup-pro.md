## Post-Implementation Processes for AI Chatbots

### Overall Implementation Strategy
We recommend a quality-focused, phased post-implementation process.

### Phase 1 (Immediately After Implementation) - Quality Assurance

#### Data Preparation and Organization
- Organize existing FAQs and manuals with attention to readability
- Thoroughly check information for accuracy and currency
- Verify comprehensive coverage of common question patterns

#### Initial Implementation Operations
- Learn using URL Retriever or Document Retriever
- Escalate unanswerable questions to human operators
- Record questions that AI cannot handle (conversations with AI chatbots are recorded as LiveAgent tickets)

### Phase 2 (1-2 months later) - Improving Data Quality

#### Inquiry Analysis
- Analyze actual inquiry content
- Identify frequent questions and add them to FAQs

#### Content Improvement
- Identify and improve ambiguous expressions and insufficient information
- Evaluate content using readability tools and simplify, shorten, and restructure text
- Update to accurate, business-appropriate information
- Expand FAQ and knowledge base

### Phase 3 (3 months and beyond) - Continuous Quality Management

#### Regular Updates
- Set up regular crawling schedules using scheduling features
- Continuous content expansion
- Test readability and re-evaluate improvement levels

#### Quality Maintenance
- Regular accuracy checks of information
- Addition of new inquiry patterns
- AI response accuracy improves, significantly enhancing self-service resolution rates

### Expected Implementation Benefits
- First Contact Resolution (FCR) improves by up to 28%
- Response time reduced by up to 73%
- Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) improves by 10 points
- Inquiry handling volume reduced by up to 52%

### Quality Management Key Points
- Recognize that poor data quality is the biggest challenge in AI implementation
- Focus on improving "quality" rather than increasing "quantity"
- Understand that insufficient information and ambiguous expressions directly impact response accuracy
- Establish processes for regular review and updates
