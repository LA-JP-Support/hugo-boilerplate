## Content Strategy for AI Chatbot Implementation

**In AI chatbot implementation, content 'quality' is more important than 'quantity'**. Poor data quality is often cited as a major challenge when implementing AI.

### Key Points for Content Quality

#### Accurate and Up-to-date Information
- Outdated or incorrect content directly affects AI response accuracy
- Regular updates and verification of information accuracy are essential

#### Content Appropriate for Business and Purpose
- Customer service: Comprehensive coverage of frequently asked questions and user inquiry patterns
- FAQ automation: Content reflecting actual customer needs
- Technical support: Troubleshooting procedures and product specifications

#### Content Structure and Readability
- Use simple language (avoid technical terms or provide explanations)
- Concise sentences (aim for 15-20 words per sentence)
- Write in active voice ("The team submitted the report")
- Structure with headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs
- Aim for **middle school level readability**

### Quantitative Aspects of Content

While specific numerical standards cannot be clearly defined, the following content can be considered **sufficient implementation conditions**:

- 50 FAQ items: Sufficient for basic inquiry response
- 100-page manual: Can be utilized as a comprehensive knowledge base
- 200 inquiry cases: Valuable learning material reflecting actual customer needs

### Risks to Consider During Implementation

#### Risks from Information Deficiency
- **Insufficient information**: AI's response range is limited, leading to increased escalation to humans
- **Ambiguous expressions**: AI response accuracy decreases, potentially causing customer misunderstandings
- **Lack of information comprehensiveness**: Missing common question patterns prevents response to even basic inquiries

### Operational Approach

When implemented with limited content, AI will only respond accurately within its learned scope and escalate questions outside its coverage area to human operators.

**A gradual approach of adding content over time is recommended.**
