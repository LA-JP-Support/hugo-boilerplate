## Features of AI Chatbot Plans and Companies Suitable for Implementation

### 24/7 Automated Support System

AI chatbot plans are like excellent staff members that automatically respond to customers' frequently asked questions and work 24/7 without breaks. They are particularly ideal for companies that need to handle inquiries outside business hours and on holidays.

### Flexible Implementation and Multilingual Support

They can accommodate a wide range of companies from small to large enterprises and are suitable for businesses that want to establish a comprehensive customer support system at low cost. With escalation functionality that smoothly transfers complex questions to human staff, you can implement the system with confidence. The multilingual support feature (approximately 100 languages) including English, Chinese, and Spanish makes them ideal for companies expanding their global business.

### Benefits for Customer Satisfaction Improvement

Additionally, since they can handle multiple customers simultaneously, they are suitable for companies that want to reduce waiting times and improve customer satisfaction, as well as businesses with many overseas customers in different time zones or customers who are active during nighttime hours.
