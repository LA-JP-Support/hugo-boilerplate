## Comparison Between FlowHunt and ChatGPT API

### Purpose and Features

FlowHunt specializes in business use and can limit response scope to company data. ChatGPT API is general-purpose but requires all custom implementation. When leveraging corporate knowledge bases or proprietary data, the approaches of both solutions differ significantly.

### FlowHunt's Advantages

Corporate confidential data can be managed in a secure environment without exposure to external parties. Access permissions can be configured according to each department or position, minimizing information leakage risks.

### ChatGPT API Features

#### Versatility
- Compatible with a wide range of applications
- Flexible implementation possible

OpenAI's ChatGPT API provides general-purpose language models that can be used across diverse fields. It offers flexibility to handle a wide range of use cases including programming, text generation, and translation.

#### Implementation Challenges
- All features must be developed in-house
- Custom implementation of security measures required

When using ChatGPT API, significant development resources are required for customizations to meet enterprise-specific requirements and adding security features. Data protection, access control, and privacy management must be built independently.

### Selection Criteria

When enterprises select AI solutions, it's important to consider the following perspectives:
- Data security requirements
- Customization necessity
- Ease of integration with existing systems
- Implementation costs and operational burden

FlowHunt provides a simpler and more secure approach to address these challenges.
