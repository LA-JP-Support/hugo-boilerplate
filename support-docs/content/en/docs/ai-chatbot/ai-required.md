## Preparation for AI Chatbot Development

Building SmartWeb's AI chatbot primarily requires "knowledge base preparation" and "establishing operational systems."

## Three Methods for Knowledge Base Construction

The information source (knowledge base) for AI chatbot responses can be built through the following three methods:

### 1. Website Crawling

Regularly crawl your company's website to automatically gather the latest information.

- Full domain crawling
- Specific page designation
- Sitemap-based crawling
- Periodic automatic update settings

### 2. Q&A List Registration

Manually register and manage frequently asked questions and answers.

- Utilize customer portal knowledge base
- Immediate reflection
- Prioritized presentation as responses

### 3. Document Upload

Upload existing materials directly.

**Supported file formats:**
- PDF documents
- Word documents (DOCX/DOC)
- Excel (XLS/XLSX)
- Text files (TXT)
- CSV files
- Markdown
- HTML
- YouTube video URLs

## Materials to Prepare

### Essential Materials

- **FAQ content**: Frequently asked questions and answers (minimum 50 items recommended)
- **Product/service information**: Basic explanatory materials

### Recommended Materials

- Knowledge base articles and internal manual documents
- Product catalogs and specifications (PDF format recommended)
- Company introduction materials and presentation documents
- Video content (YouTube video URLs)
- Existing support articles and documentation

## Operational Preparation

### Establishing Operational Systems

- **Designating operational staff**: 1-2 people recommended
- **Setting response scope**: Determining question categories the chatbot will handle
- **Escalation conditions**: Designing handoff timing to human operators

### Things to Decide

- Policy for handling questions the AI cannot answer
- Response policy for after-hours inquiries
- Methods for monitoring response quality

## Content Quality

AI chatbot response accuracy heavily depends on knowledge base quality.

### Conditions for Good Content

- **Accurate and current information**: Outdated information affects response accuracy
- **Clear writing**: Avoid technical terms or provide explanations
- **Comprehensiveness**: Cover common question patterns

### Content Creation Tips

- Keep sentences short (15-20 words as guideline)
- Use headings and bullet points for structure
- Avoid ambiguous expressions
- Use active voice

## Knowledge Base Creation Service

SmartWeb also provides support services for knowledge base creation.

- Create question and answer drafts from past inquiries, homepages, manuals, product catalogs, etc.
- Cost: 50,000 yen and up

**Important notes:**
- Customer review and structuring of draft content required
- Input into support portal is customer-side work

## Implementation Process

1. **Requirements definition hearing**: Clarify business goals and response scope
2. **Knowledge survey**: Inventory existing documents and FAQs
3. **System construction**: FlowHunt environment setup and LiveAgent integration configuration
4. **Knowledge base preparation**: Crawl settings, document uploads, Q&A registration
5. **Testing and tuning**: Verify and adjust response quality
6. **Launch operations**: Gradual rollout and monitoring
