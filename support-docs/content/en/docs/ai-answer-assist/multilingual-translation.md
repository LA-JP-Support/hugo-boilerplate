## Multilingual Translation Features

Using the custom instruction feature of AI Answer Assist (AI Answer Improver), translation between Japanese and multiple languages is possible.

## How to Use Translation

### Basic Translation

By simply entering "translate to English" in the custom instructions, you can instantly translate Japanese responses into English.

**Examples of supported languages:**
- English
- Chinese (Simplified and Traditional)
- Korean
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Many others

### Translation + Style Adjustment

Style adjustment is possible simultaneously with translation.

**Examples:**
- "Translate to English with formal expressions"
- "Translate to Chinese with easy-to-understand expressions"

## Use Cases

### Supporting International Customers

For foreign language inquiries, you can create natural foreign language responses by first drafting a response in Japanese and then translating it.

### Streamlining Multilingual Support

Even staff members who are not proficient in foreign languages can provide high-quality foreign language support by utilizing AI Answer Assist's translation feature.

### Technical Content Translation

Technical responses containing specialized terminology are also appropriately translated by AI. You can add instructions such as "include original terms alongside specialized vocabulary" as needed.

## Important Notes

### Importance of Final Review

Translation results must always be reviewed by staff before sending. For important or specialized content, we recommend review by native speakers.

### Cultural Considerations

Depending on the language, attention to cultural differences in expression may be necessary. Please verify that expressions are appropriate for the recipient's culture.
