## Three-Level Formality Selection

AI Answer Assist (AI Answer Improver) allows you to choose from three different tone levels to match the situation.

### Casual

A friendly and approachable writing style that creates a warm impression.

**Suitable situations:**
- Responding to repeat customers
- Companies with casual brand images
- Social media or chat interactions
- Responding to younger customers

### Neutral

A balanced writing style that is neither overly formal nor casual.

**Suitable situations:**
- Responding to first-time customers
- General inquiry responses
- Addressing diverse customer demographics
- When unsure which style to choose

### Business-like

A polite, business-oriented expression that conveys a professional impression.

**Suitable situations:**
- Responding to B2B (business-to-business) customers
- Handling complaints or concerns
- Situations requiring formal responses
- Inquiries about high-value products or services

## Choosing the Right Style for Customers

Even with the same content, changing the formality can significantly alter the impression. By selecting the optimal tone based on customer relationships and inquiry content, more effective communication becomes possible.

## Combining with Custom Instructions

You can make even finer adjustments by combining formality selection with custom instructions. For example, you can select "Business-like" and then add custom instructions such as "make the expression a bit warmer."
