## Tips for Effective Instructions

### Be Specific with Instructions

Instead of saying "make it better," clearly communicate what you want done, such as "add explanations for technical terms."

### Clarify the Target

Specify whether you want to adjust the entire text or just specific parts to get more accurate results.

### Don't Fear Trial and Error

If you don't get the expected results, try changing the wording of your instructions and try again. Since all editing history is saved, it's easy to start over.
