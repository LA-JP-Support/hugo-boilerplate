## Security and Integration Methods

AI Answer Assist (AI Answer Improver) is designed with security as a priority and can be operated safely.

## Integration Methods

AI Answer Assist operates in conjunction with one of the following:

### FlowHunt Integration

This is SmartWeb's standard integration method. AI functionality is utilized through the FlowHunt platform.

**Features:**
- Included in the SmartWeb contract
- Can integrate with FlowHunt's knowledge base
- No additional API contract required

### OpenAI Integration

This is a method where customers contract directly with OpenAI and use their own API key.

**Features:**
- Uses customer's own API key
- Prevents external leakage of confidential information
- Separate API usage fees apply

## Security Measures

### Data Handling

- Input text is used only for AI processing
- Care must be taken when handling documents containing confidential or personal information
- When using OpenAI integration, data management follows your contract terms since your API key is used

### Operational Precautions

- AI Answer Assist output must always be reviewed by an operator before sending to customers
- When inputting highly confidential information, please follow your company's security policies
- Regular API key rotation is recommended (for OpenAI integration)

## Usage Requirements for OpenAI Integration

When using AI Answer Assist with OpenAI integration, the following are required:

1. Direct contract with OpenAI
2. Obtaining a valid API key
3. Payment of API usage fees (pay-per-use)

**Note:** Contracts with OpenAI and API usage fees are separate from SmartWeb usage fees.
