## Information Integration from Multiple Documents

In customer support, it's common to collect information from multiple manuals, FAQs, and technical documents to create responses. AI Answer Assist (AI Answer Improver) enables you to perform this task efficiently.

## Challenge: Scattered Information

When copying and pasting information from multiple documents, the following issues tend to occur:

- Inconsistent writing style and tone
- Uneven levels of detail in explanations
- Unnatural text flow
- Duplicate information

## Solution

### Step 1: Gather Information

Copy and paste the necessary information from multiple sources. At this stage, it doesn't need to be organized.

### Step 2: Improve with AI Answer Assist

Input the collected information into AI Answer Assist and select the "Improve" option.

AI automatically performs the following:
- Restructures the text composition
- Optimizes the flow
- Removes duplicates
- Unifies to a consistent writing style

### Step 3: Additional Adjustments (As Needed)

Use custom instructions to make further fine-tuned adjustments.

**Examples:**
- "Add explanations for technical terms"
- "Bring the conclusion to the beginning"
- "Rearrange in the order customers want to know"

## Use Cases
