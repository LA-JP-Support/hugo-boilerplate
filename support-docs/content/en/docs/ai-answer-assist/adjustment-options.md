## 4 Text Adjustment Options

AI Answer Assist (AI Answer Improver) provides four powerful options for optimizing existing text.

### 1. Improve

**Refines text to make it clearer and more professional.**

Polishes expressions in text created by staff and converts it into a well-organized, readable format. Creates high-quality text suitable for business communication.

### 2. Extend

**Enriches text with detailed explanations and additional information.**

Adds necessary supplementary explanations and background information to responses that are too brief. Creates more complete answers that are easier for customers to understand.

### 3. Simplify

**Summarizes complex content into concise and understandable text.**

Converts specialized content or lengthy text into simple expressions that capture the key points. Creates responses that are easy to understand even for busy customers.

### 4. Custom Instructions

**Allows you to request detailed adjustments from AI with your own instructions.**

By inputting specific instructions such as "add explanations for technical terms," "adjust the level of politeness," or "convert to bullet points," you can make text adjustments tailored to your purpose.

## Usage Examples

### Organizing Information from Multiple Materials

When copying and pasting information from multiple documents, you can use the "Improve" option to restructure the text composition and convert scattered information into a consistent reply.

### Clear Explanations of Technical Terms

After creating technical responses, you can specify "add explanations for technical terms" using custom instructions to convert them into text that's understandable even for customers without specialized knowledge.

### Adjusting Response Length

You can add details to responses that are too short using "Extend," and narrow down key points for responses that are too long using "Simplify," creating responses of appropriate length that match customer needs.

## Saving Edit History

All edit history is saved, allowing you to select the optimal response from multiple versions. Redoing and comparative review can be performed easily.
