### Why FlowHunt Only

AI email response composition uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to search for relevant information from your company's knowledge base and generate accurate responses. To realize this functionality, integration with FlowHunt's knowledge sources (Schedules, Q&A, Documents) is necessary.

## Getting Started Process

AI email response composition becomes immediately available upon implementing SmartWeb's AI Customer Support.

1. **SmartWeb Implementation** - Initial setup performed by SmartWeb team
2. **Knowledge Base Construction** - Register FAQs, manuals, and product information in FlowHunt
3. **FlowHunt Integration Setup** - Connect LiveAgent with FlowHunt
4. **Start Using in Ticket Screen** - Response suggestions automatically generated when emails are received

## Integration with AI Response Assist

Drafts generated by AI email response composition can be further refined with **AI Response Assist**.

```
Customer email received
       ↓
AI Email Response Composition (automatic draft generation)
       ↓
AI Response Assist (text refinement)
       ↓
Operator review and editing
       ↓
     Send
```

The combination of these two AI features simultaneously achieves significant reduction in response time and quality improvement.
