## Three-Level Tone Selection

The AI Email Answer Composer allows you to **select response tone from three levels**. You can generate responses with optimal formality based on customer relationships and inquiry content.

## Available Tones

### Casual

A friendly writing style that uses approachable expressions and gives a personable impression.

**Suitable situations:**
- Repeat customers
- Casual brand image
- Services targeting younger demographics
- Inquiries from social media

### Neutral

A balanced writing style that is neither overly formal nor casual.

**Suitable situations:**
- First-time customers
- General inquiries
- Addressing a broad customer base
- When unsure which tone to choose

### Business

A polite, business-oriented writing style that gives a professional impression.

**Suitable situations:**
- B2B (business-to-business)
- Responding to complaints or grievances
- Situations requiring formal responses
- Inquiries involving contracts or legal content

## Combining with Custom Instructions

In addition to tone selection, you can make more detailed adjustments by adding custom instructions.

**Examples:**
- "Business tone, but with warm expressions"
- "Casual, but still use polite language"
- "Include specific information (e.g., campaign announcements)"

## Key Points for Tone Selection

### Maintain Consistency

When responding to the same customer, try to maintain the same tone to create a consistent impression.

### Adapt to Situations

Use appropriate tones for different situations - neutral for regular inquiries, business for complaint responses, etc.

### Final Review by Staff

Always have staff confirm whether the AI-generated tone is appropriate before sending.
