## Automatic Routing Feature

By leveraging LiveAgent's ticket system automation rules, you can **automatically switch the learning information that the AI references based on the destination and content of incoming emails**.

## How It Works

### Automatic Identification

The system automatically identifies which product or service the inquiry relates to based on the email's destination address, subject line, keywords in the body, and other factors.

### Automatic Knowledge Switching

Based on the identification results, the AI automatically switches the knowledge base it references.

**Examples:**
- Email to Product A → References Product A technical information
- Email to Service B → References Service B manual
- Email to Department C → References Department C response guidelines

### Generate Optimal Responses

Based on the switched knowledge base, the system automatically generates response drafts optimized for that specific product or service.

## Examples of Configurable Rules

### Routing by Email Address

- support-productA@example.com → Product A knowledge
- support-productB@example.com → Product B knowledge
- billing@example.com → Billing-related knowledge

### Routing by Subject/Body Keywords

- Contains "Product A" → Product A knowledge
- Contains "return" or "refund" → Return handling knowledge
- Contains "contract" or "renewal" → Contract-related knowledge

### Routing by Language

- Japanese emails → Japanese knowledge
- English emails → English knowledge

## Benefits

### Support for Large-Scale Operations

Even companies handling multiple products and services can automatically generate responses optimized for each one.

### Operational Efficiency

There's no need for staff to manually select knowledge bases, as the appropriate information is automatically referenced.

### Consistent Response Quality

Since the appropriate knowledge is used for each product and service, consistent high-quality responses can be maintained.

## Flexible Rule Configuration

Flexible rule configuration is possible by department, brand, language, and more. You can design operations that match your business structure.
