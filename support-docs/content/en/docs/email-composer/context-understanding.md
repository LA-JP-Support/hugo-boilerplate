## Context-Aware Response Generation

AI Answer Composer is an intelligent response generation tool that automatically analyzes ticket conversation history and **generates appropriate response drafts with contextual understanding**.

## How It Works

### Conversation History Analysis

AI reviews all interactions within the ticket:

- Initial customer inquiry
- Previous agent responses
- Additional questions or information from customers
- Attachment content (when supported)

### Context Understanding

Rather than simply picking up keywords, it understands the conversation flow and background.

**Examples:**
- What the customer is trying to resolve
- What methods have already been tried
- What level of technical expertise they have
- What kind of response they expect

### Appropriate Response Generation

Based on the context, it generates optimal response drafts:

- Avoids repeating already answered content
- Directly addresses customer questions
- Provides necessary additional information

## Benefits

### Consistent Support

Even when agents change, consistent support based on conversation history is possible.

### Efficient Response Creation

Reduces the time agents spend reviewing conversation history, as AI grasps key points and creates response drafts.

### Improved Customer Satisfaction

Avoids situations like "As we explained before..." and prevents customer frustration.

## Use Cases

### Multi-Round Inquiries

**Scenario:** Third interaction where the customer still hasn't resolved their issue

AI understands:
- Original inquiry content
- Previously suggested solutions
- Results the customer has tried

Then generates response drafts proposing solutions not yet attempted.

### Agent Handoffs

**Scenario:** Taking over a ticket handled by a previous agent

AI grasps the situation from conversation history and generates response drafts based on the previous agent's handling. New agents can provide appropriate responses without needing to read through detailed conversation history.

## Important Notes

AI-generated response drafts are drafts only. Agents must always review the content and make necessary modifications before sending. We especially recommend careful review for complex cases or those involving sensitive content.
