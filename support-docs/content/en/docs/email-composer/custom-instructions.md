## Important Notes

The more specific your custom instructions are, the more likely you are to get the desired results. Rather than vague instructions, clearly communicate "what" you want and "how" you want it done.

Also, always have a staff member review AI-generated responses before sending. Especially when using custom instructions, we recommend carefully checking whether the content matches your intentions.
