## Basic Differences Between the Three AI Features

SmartWeb has three AI features with different purposes and users.

| Item | AI Chatbot | AI Response Assist | AI Email Response Creation |
|------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Target User | Customers (End Users) | Operators | Operators |
| Purpose | Automatically answer customer questions | Text improvement, translation, adjustment | Generate email reply drafts |
| Operation Timing | 24/7 automatic operation | Manual use | Manual use |
| Input | Customer questions | Text created by operators | Customer emails and contact forms |
| Output | Automatic replies to customers | Improved text | Email reply drafts |
| Information Source | Knowledge Base (RAG) | Input text only | Knowledge Base (RAG) |

## What is AI Chatbot?

### 24-Hour Automated Response System for Customers

AI chatbot is a system installed on websites that **automatically responds to customer inquiries 24 hours a day**.

### How It Works

1. Customer enters question in chat
2. AI searches for relevant information from knowledge base (FAQ, manuals, website) using RAG
3. Generates optimal response based on search results
4. Displays response directly to customer

### Main Features

- **Automated Response**: Responds instantly without human intervention
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatically responds in approximately 100 languages
- **Escalation**: Complex questions are transferred to human operators
- **Lead Generation**: Guides users to contact forms

### Suitable Scenarios

- Responding to inquiries outside business hours
- Instant answers to frequently asked questions
- Multi-language inquiries from overseas
- Initial response to large volumes of inquiries

## What is AI Response Assist?

### Text Improvement Tool for Operators

AI response assist is a feature that **instantly helps AI improve text created by operators**.

### How It Works

1. Operator creates response text
2. Selects improvement mode in AI response assist
3. AI improves and adjusts the text
4. Operator reviews and edits before sending

### Main Features

- **Text Improvement**: Revises to clearer expressions
- **Expansion**: Expands short answers with more detail
- **Simplification**: Summarizes long text
- **Tone Adjustment**: Adjusts writing style from casual to business
- **Translation**: Multi-language translation support

### Suitable Scenarios

- Combining information from multiple sources into unified text
- Rephrasing technical terms in understandable language
- Email correspondence in foreign languages
- Maintaining consistent response quality

## What is AI Email Response Creation?

### Automatic Draft Generation for Email and Contact Form Replies

AI email response creation is a feature that **analyzes customer emails and contact forms and automatically generates reply drafts**.

### How It Works

1. Receives email or contact form from customer
2. AI analyzes content and understands question intent
3. Searches for relevant information from knowledge base (RAG)
4. Automatically generates email reply draft
5. Operator reviews and edits before sending

### Main Features

- **Intent Analysis**: Automatically identifies question intent from customer emails
- **Draft Generation**: Creates response proposals based on knowledge base
- **Multiple Question Support**: Handles cases with multiple questions in one email
- **Tone Setting**: Generates in writing style matching company brand

### Suitable Scenarios

- Efficiently processing large volumes of email inquiries
- Maintaining response quality and consistency
- Training and supporting new operators
- Reducing response time for complex inquiries

## Comparison of the Three Features

### Differences in Information Sources (Knowledge Base)

| Feature | Information Source | RAG Technology |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| AI Chatbot | Knowledge Base (FAQ, manuals, websites) | ✓ Used |
| AI Response Assist | Only text input by operators | × Not used |
| AI Email Response Creation | Knowledge Base (FAQ, manuals, websites) | ✓ Used |

**Key Point**: AI chatbot and AI email response creation **share the same knowledge base**. Once knowledge is organized, consistent responses are possible for both chat and email.

### Differences in Output Destinations

| Feature | Output Destination |
|---------|-------------------|
| AI Chatbot | Directly displayed to customers (automatic) |
| AI Response Assist | Operator's screen (sent after confirmation) |
| AI Email Response Creation | Operator's screen (sent after confirmation) |

### Human Involvement

| Feature | Human Involvement |
|---------|-------------------|
| AI Chatbot | Not required (fully automatic) |
| AI Response Assist | Required (text creation → AI improvement → confirmation and sending) |
| AI Email Response Creation | Required (draft confirmation → editing → sending) |

## Which Feature Should You Use?

### When AI Chatbot is Optimal

- Want to achieve **24-hour support**
- Want to automate **frequently asked questions**
- Want to filter inquiries that require human response
- Want to improve customer satisfaction with **instant responses**

### When AI Response Assist is Optimal

- Want to **improve operators' text quality**
- Need **translation** or **tone adjustment**
- Want to **standardize** response quality across staff
- Have existing text that needs **improvement**

### When AI Email Response Creation is Optimal

- **Efficiency in email and contact form responses** is top priority
- Need **accurate responses** based on knowledge base
- Want to process **large volumes of email**
- Want to maintain response **consistency**

## Combining the Three Features

SmartWeb allows you to use all three AI features in combination.

### Recommended Workflow

```
Customer Inquiry
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┐
   ↓         ↓
 Chat      Email/Contact Form
   ↓         ↓
AI Chatbot   AI Email Response Creation

```

### Benefits of Knowledge Base Sharing

Since AI chatbot and AI email response creation use the same knowledge base:

- **Single setup for both**: Register FAQ and manuals once to use for both chat and email
- **Response consistency**: Provide same quality responses across all channels
- **Maintenance efficiency**: Knowledge updates immediately reflect in both systems

### Combined Effects

This combination can achieve the following effects:

- **73% reduction in response time**: Instant response through AI chatbot
- **82% reduction in response tasks**: Efficiency through automation and draft generation
- **Improved response quality**: Text improvement through AI response assist
- **Ensured consistency**: Responses based on shared knowledge base

## Summary

| Feature | In One Phrase | Knowledge Base |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| AI Chatbot | **Automatically responds** to customers | Shared (uses RAG) |
| AI Response Assist | **Improves** operator text | Not used |
| AI Email Response Creation | **Creates drafts** for email replies | Shared (uses RAG) |

While each of the three features has different roles, they achieve maximum effectiveness when combined. Particularly, AI chatbot and AI email response creation share a knowledge base, enabling efficient operation.
