## About Activity Log Retrieval

### Features with Log Retrieval Capability

SmartWeb provides detailed activity log functionality to ensure advanced security and transparency. By selecting an appropriate plan, you can track all important operations within the system and retrieve information necessary for auditing.

### Main Activity Logs Recorded

Activity logs include records of the following important activities:

- Ticket change history (creation, updates, status changes, assignee changes, etc.)
- Knowledge base edit history (article additions, updates, deletions)
- Login history (users, date/time, IP addresses)
- User permission changes
- System configuration updates

### Information Required for Auditing

Activity logs are essential tools for corporate compliance and information security management. For example, they meet auditing needs such as:

- Tracking who performed what operations and when
- Identifying unauthorized access or suspicious activities
- Ensuring transparency of internal processes
- Compliance with regulatory requirements

Specifically, logs record detailed information such as the username of the operator, timestamps, and change details, making them useful for investigating causes when problems occur and managing audit trails. This is an ideal feature for companies seeking advanced security.
