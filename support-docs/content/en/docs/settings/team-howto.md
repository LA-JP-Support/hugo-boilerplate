## Team Overview
Create "Teams" to organize agents in charge of specific products, services, or departments. Dedicated agents belonging to each team can efficiently process tickets. This section introduces "Team Creation", "Agent Registration", and "Creating Email Templates by Team".

## Team Setup

### Creating a New Team
From Settings > Teams in the left menu of the agent screen, click the "Create Team" button.

- Enter the team name and click "Create" to create a team as shown below.

[※In the figure below, two teams - General and Support - have been created]

### Registering Agents to Teams
Use the "Edit" button for the created team to add agents to join the team. Simply click "+Add" next to the agent you want to register, then "Save" to complete the setup.

You can also select the communication channels you want agents to handle from here. By clicking the "Email" or "Chat" icons next to registered agent names, you can set whether each channel is used or not.

### Creating Email Templates by Team
Teams can create and use their own email templates in addition to the common email templates created in "Email" settings. By having administrators register them in advance, each agent can perform customer service duties without having to worry about using different signatures.

If no template is created from this screen, the common email template will be automatically applied.

### Assigning Automation Rules to Teams
Once agents belonging to the support team are determined, set up "assignment conditions" and "forwarding rules" from LiveAgent's rule settings to assign tickets to the most suitable agents. For each team, you can configure email signatures, phone numbers, and chat response rules.
