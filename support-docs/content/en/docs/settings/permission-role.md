## Permission Management Overview

LiveAgent enables **granular permission management**. You can set access permissions for each user to ensure security.

## Standard Roles

Three types of standard roles are available.

| Role | Permission Level | Main Permissions |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **Owner** | Highest | Access to all settings, management, and billing information |
| **Administrator** | High | System settings, user management, report viewing |
| **Agent** | Standard | Practical operations for ticket handling and chat support |

## Configurable Permissions

The following permissions can be individually configured for each role.

| Permission Category | Configuration Items |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Tickets** | View, edit, delete, view other agents' tickets |
| **Knowledge Base** | Edit and publish articles |
| **Reports** | View and export |
| **Settings** | Change permissions |
| **User Management** | Add and edit agents |

## Custom Roles

In addition to standard roles, you can create **custom roles**.

### Benefits of Custom Roles

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Flexible Permission Settings** | Set detailed permissions according to business needs |
| **Enhanced Security** | Operate with minimum necessary permissions |
| **Organizational Support** | Management tailored to team structure |

### Use Cases
