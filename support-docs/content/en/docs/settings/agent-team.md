## Agents and Teams in LiveAgent

### Agent Overview

Support staff who log into LiveAgent to provide customer support are called "Agents". These agents can be grouped by job type and organized into "Teams".

### Agent Roles and Types

#### Agent

"Agents" are dedicated staff for customer service. Their primary responsibility is processing tickets, handling all customer contact channels, and answering questions and inquiries.

#### Administrator

"Administrators" handle help desk management duties in addition to agent responsibilities. They manage system settings and operational reports to build better support environments.

#### Owner

"Owners" are administrators who also manage account contracts. They are created when registering a LiveAgent account.

### Key Points for Agent Selection

It's best to add all staff related to the products and services you provide support for. This allows you to always assign tickets to the appropriate specialist staff.

Assigned agents don't need to be constantly logged into LiveAgent. They can handle responses simply by replying to "notification emails" sent by the system.

## Team Organization

### Purpose and Significance of Team Organization

When using LiveAgent with multiple agents, agents are gathered to form "Teams". Team organization makes it possible to elevate ticket processing responsibility from the "individual" to the "department" level.

### Team Organization Classification Methods

Teams can be structured based on the following elements:

- Job function (e.g., HR, IT, Accounting, etc.)
- Products/Services (e.g., product names, categories, etc.)
- Customer type (e.g., general members, VIP members, dealers, etc.)
- Region/Area (e.g., Kansai, Kanto, etc.)

### Benefits of Team Organization

- Limit access to tickets for specific products/services to agents belonging to designated teams
- Create and edit email templates for each team
- Configure chat, phone, and messaging service usage settings for each team

### Notes for Single Users

If you're using LiveAgent for a single service, website, or SOHO, there's no need to create teams. If you want to group tickets by business content, using rule settings or tagging is convenient.
