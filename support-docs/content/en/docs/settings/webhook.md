## Basic Webhook Features

### Webhook Support
SmartWeb's Webhook feature enables real-time integration between the ticket management system and external systems. When events such as ticket creation, updates, or replies occur, JSON data can be automatically POSTed to specified URLs. This allows for real-time information synchronization and significant improvement in operational efficiency.

### Integration Features
- Real-time data transmission: Immediately notify external systems of ticket status changes
- Flexible integration with external systems: Easy integration with CRMs, project management tools, notification systems, and more
- JSON data format POSTing: Efficient integration of structured data
- Customizable endpoints: Flexible configuration tailored to specific needs

### Usage Examples
Webhooks demonstrate their power in scenarios such as:

1. Customer support system integration
   - Automatically notify Slack when tickets are created
   - Share important cases with stakeholders in real-time

2. Business process automation
   - Sync with project management tools when ticket status changes
   - Automatically update work progress

3. Data analysis and tracking
   - Automatically send ticket information to analysis tools
   - Monitor customer support performance in real-time

With this Webhook feature, seamless information integration between different systems becomes possible, significantly improving operational efficiency and customer support quality.
