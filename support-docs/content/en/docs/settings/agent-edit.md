## Agent Editing Overview

You can individually configure detailed settings for newly created "Agents".

## Agent Detailed Settings

### Personal Information Details

You can edit the information registered in "Create Agent". The editable information is as follows:

- Agent avatar (icon) image
- Agent name
- Person in charge's email address
- Role (agent permissions)
- Login password
- Gender

### Email Notifications

Edit the content to be notified to the email address registered in "Personal Information Details". This notification can be configured simply by clicking checkboxes. The notifiable content is as follows:

- Send email to agent when a ticket is assigned to the agent
- Send email to agent when a customer replies to an assigned ticket
- Send email to agent when a new ticket is created by a member of their team

### Teams

You can register and change the teams that agents belong to in bulk. You can also configure from here whether agents can change the channels they can handle themselves.

### Signature

Create and edit signatures that agents attach when replying to emails in LiveAgent. Signatures can also be created for each team the agent belongs to. For example, you can configure to use a common signature except for replies from specific teams.

## Agent Settings

### Maximum Concurrent Chats

You can set the number of live chat incoming calls that an agent can handle simultaneously. When the number of chat incoming calls from customers exceeds the agent's maximum concurrent chat number, customers who are not being handled will be in a chat response waiting state and the number of waiting customers will be displayed on the agent screen.

### Chat Priority

When there are multiple agents, you can individually set the assignment priority for live chats. By default, "50" is assigned to all agents, and changing this value affects how easily incoming calls are received.

### Level

One of LiveAgent's gamification features, you can select the agent's response level. Usually starting from "Level 1", agents naturally level up as they continue customer service work, similar to their skills.
