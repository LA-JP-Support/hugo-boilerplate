## Approach to Required Staff for Operation

### Factors Affecting Staffing Scale

The number of staff required for chatbot and live chat operations varies significantly depending on the following factors:

- Number of brands, products, and services handled
- Customer support channels (live chat, phone, email, etc.)
- Expected volume and complexity of inquiries
- Business hours and supported languages

For example, companies with multiple brands need support staff with specialized knowledge for each brand. On the other hand, utilizing AI chatbots can reduce the personnel needed for initial response.

### Improving Operational Efficiency

SmartWeb's solutions enable significant efficiency improvements compared to traditional customer support systems:

- Improved automatic response rates through AI chatbots
- Efficient customer support using LiveAgent
- Optimal assignment to appropriate staff through flow hunting functionality

These features allow you to serve more customers with your current staff without additional personnel investment.

### Utilizing AI Chatbots

AI chatbots contribute significantly to staff reduction:

- 24-hour automatic responses to routine questions
- Automatic routing of complex inquiries to appropriate staff
- Continuous improvement of responses through learning functions

As a result, high-quality customer support becomes possible with fewer staff members, enabling significant reduction in operational costs.
