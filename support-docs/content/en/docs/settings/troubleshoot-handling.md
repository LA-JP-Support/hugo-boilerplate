## Support System for Troubleshooting

### Support Response Features
SmartWeb has established a dual support system with both the developer and our company. This support approach enables swift and accurate response to customer issues. The main features include:

- 24-hour support by specialized teams
- Immediate analysis of technical issues
- Multi-language support desk

### Real-time Operational Status Monitoring
We provide a status page that allows you to monitor the current state of the system in real-time. On this page, you can check the following information:

- Operational status of each service
- Current ongoing failures and maintenance information
- Past incident history

When trouble occurs, we recommend first checking the overall situation on the status page (https://status.liveagent.com/). If the system as a whole is not affected, please contact our dedicated support channel.

To support rapid problem resolution for customers, we utilize LiveAgent and FlowHunt features to achieve efficient support response. We flexibly handle technical challenges and aim to resolve issues with minimal downtime.
