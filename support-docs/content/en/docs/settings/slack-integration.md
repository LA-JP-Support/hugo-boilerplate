## Slack Integration

### Overview
Slack is a popular team communication tool.

The integration plugin provides the option to automatically receive notifications in selected Slack channels for the following purposes:

　・New tickets
　・Open tickets (replies from customers)
　・Resolved tickets

### Setup Instructions

#### Plugin Activation
The first step is to enable the "Slack Integration" plugin in the list under "Settings" > "System" > "Plugins". When you enable the plugin, you will be prompted to restart the agent panel.

#### Slack Authentication
After activation and restart, click "Add to Slack" displayed on the screen when you click "Details". An authentication window will pop up. Here you select the team to use and the channel to send notifications to.

#### Notification Settings
Once authentication is complete, return to the LiveAgent agent panel and click "Configure" for the plugin to set up notifications.

### Notification Features
Clicking on the ticket code in notifications received in Slack will access the corresponding ticket in LiveAgent.

### Privacy Policy
The application does not store private data, passwords, communications, or other sensitive information. It is used only to notify the selected Slack channel with messages regarding ticket status.
