Yes, LiveAgent, which is used for SmartWeb's AI customer support, supports two-factor authentication (2FA) using Google Authenticator.

## Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication

By requiring a 6-digit one-time code in addition to your password during login, account security is significantly enhanced. Even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access can be prevented.

## Available Authentication Methods

- **Integration with authentication apps** such as Google Authenticator
- **SSO integration with Google or Microsoft accounts** (Single Sign-On), which can also indirectly apply two-step verification

This reduces security risks and allows you to conduct customer support operations with peace of mind.
