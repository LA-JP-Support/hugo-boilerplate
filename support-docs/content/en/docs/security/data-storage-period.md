## About Data Storage Period

### Default Storage Settings

All data handled by LiveAgent is basically retained indefinitely unless the deletion function is enabled. Data includes the following:

- Ticket history
- Customer communication records
- Agent response logs
- Messages and file attachment information

This data helps with corporate record management and improving customer support quality.

### How to Configure Data Deletion

If you want to delete data, you can enable the deletion function from the database and set the number of days to automatically and completely delete deleted tickets from the database after the specified period has elapsed. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Select "Data Retention Settings" from the administrator panel
2. Set the deletion period (e.g., 30 days, 90 days, 365 days)
3. Enable the automatic deletion function

Data deletion settings are an important function from the perspective of privacy protection and storage management. By regularly organizing old data, you can maintain system performance and efficiently access necessary information.
