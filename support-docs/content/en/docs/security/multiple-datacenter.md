## Multiple Data Centers Overview

### Purpose of Data Center Deployment
A feature that deploys multiple data centers worldwide (e.g., United States, Frankfurt, Singapore) and operates on the optimal server based on user location, achieving both stability and security.

### Benefits of Region Selection
User accounts are built in the optimal region during registration, enabling access speed optimization and compliance with regulations (e.g., data laws in the country of residence). This enhances scalability and availability that would be difficult to achieve with a single location, providing reliable services even for multi-regional business expansion.

### Utilized Region for Japanese Users
Please note that users in Japan will utilize the **Singapore data center** unless otherwise requested.
