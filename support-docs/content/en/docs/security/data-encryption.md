## Data Encryption Overview

Data security is one of the most critical challenges in the digital age. At SmartWeb, we protect our customers' data with the highest level of encryption technology, providing a secure usage environment. Data in transit and at rest is strictly protected according to the latest encryption standards, minimizing the risk of information leakage.

## Communication Security

### TLS Encryption
To protect data communication over the internet, we adopt TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocols. This prevents eavesdropping and tampering during data transmission, ensuring secure communication. All API communications require HTTPS, and we thoroughly implement end-to-end encryption.

## Data Protection

### File System Encryption
We use the AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption algorithm to protect the entire file system. This method is a high-security encryption technology also adopted by military and financial institutions, preventing unauthorized external access.

### Database Protection
All information stored in databases is encrypted to ensure data confidentiality. Backup data is similarly encrypted, preparing for potential information leakage risks. This enables us to always manage customers' important information securely.

## Security Monitoring

### Security Measures
We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments by specialized teams. All access logs are recorded and monitored in detail, establishing a system that can quickly detect and respond to anomalies. Through continuous monitoring, we constantly implement the latest security measures.
