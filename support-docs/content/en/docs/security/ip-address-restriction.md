Yes, SmartWeb's AI-integrated ticket system allows you to restrict the login environment for support staff by IP address.

## Available Restriction Methods

- **Specific IP address specification**: Set individual IP addresses to allow
- **Wildcard specification**: Range specification like 192.168.1.*
- **Address range specification**: Range from start IP to end IP
- **Subnet mask specification**: Network-level restrictions

## Use Cases

- When you want to allow access only from the office
- When you want to allow only specific VPN connections during remote work
- Access control based on security policies

This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and enables secure customer support operations.
