## FlowHunt Security Measures Overview

### Comprehensive Security Approach
FlowHunt ensures security at all levels - infrastructure, data, organizational, and product - providing high reliability and security especially for small and medium-sized businesses.

## Infrastructure Security

### Data Center Physical Security
FlowHunt servers are hosted in facilities compliant with Tier IV or III+, PCI DSS, SSAE-16, or ISO 27001 standards.

- Secure perimeters with multi-level security zones
- 24/7 manned security and CCTV surveillance systems
- Biometric authentication access control
- Physical locks and security breach alarms

### Network Security
- Redundant firewalls with best-in-class router technology
- Secure communication through HTTPS encryption
- 24/7 monitoring with intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
- Industry-leading defense systems against DDoS attacks

## Data Protection and Encryption

### Data Encryption Strategy
- All FlowHunt databases and database backups containing sensitive customer data are encrypted
- Column-level encryption protects sensitive fields such as API keys
- Communication encryption through SSL/TLS protocols
- Payment data encryption is handled by payment processor (Stripe)

### Geographic Distribution of Data Centers
FlowHunt services primarily host data in the European Union (Frankfurt data center), and customers can choose to have their service data located exclusively in the US or Europe.

## Organizational Security

### Employee and Compliance
- New employees undergo thorough background checks before joining
- All employees and contractors must agree to a code of conduct
- Security awareness training is conducted at onboarding and annually

### Access Control
- Access to encryption keys is restricted to authorized users with business necessity only
- Production environment access is limited to authorized personnel only
- Access rights are reliably revoked within SLA upon termination

## Security Assessment

### Security Audits and Testing
FlowHunt conducts regular penetration testing and operates a bug bounty program that encourages external security researchers to discover vulnerabilities.

### Compliance Response
- Compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX
- Implementation of data privacy impact assessments
- Data protection through advanced methods such as differential privacy
