## Availability of Two-Factor Authentication

### Two-Step Verification with Google Authenticator

SmartWeb fully supports 2FA (two-factor authentication) using Google Authenticator. This feature significantly enhances your account security. Two-factor authentication protects against unauthorized access by requiring a 6-digit temporary code generated from a smartphone app in addition to your regular password input.

Key benefits include:
- Real-time security code generation
- Easy integration with smartphone apps
- Prevention of unauthorized logins

### Authentication Using Single Sign-On (SSO)

We also provide SSO integration (Single Sign-On) with Google and Microsoft accounts, which allows you to indirectly apply two-step verification. This approach leverages existing accounts to make the login process both simpler and more secure.

Benefits of SSO authentication:
- Use common login credentials across multiple services
- No need for additional password management
- Cloud-based integrated security

Both authentication methods prioritize the protection of user data and privacy above all else.
