## My Account Overview

"My Account" is a management interface that consolidates contract-related information for LiveAgent.

## Logging into My Account

[https://liveagent.jp/liveagent/user/account_login.php](https://liveagent.jp/liveagent/user/account_login.php)

※Due to specification changes, the "My Account" icon that was previously displayed at the bottom left of the agent panel is now hidden. Going forward, please use the login page above to access your account.

Logging into My Account requires different login information than logging into the agent panel. You can access it using the user ID/domain/password for My Account login.
